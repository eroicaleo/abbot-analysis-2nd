## 3.2 Open and Closed Sets

### 3.2.1

(a) Where in the proof of Theorem 3.2.3 part (ii) does the assumption that the collection of open sets be finite get used?

* Solution:


(b) Give an example of a countable collection of open sets $\left\{ O_1,O_2,O_3, ... \right\}$ whose intersection $\cap_{n=1}^\infty O_n$ is closed, not empty and not all of $\mathbb{R}$.

* Solution:
