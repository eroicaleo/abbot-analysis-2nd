## 6.3. Uniform Convergence and Diﬀerentiation

### Theorem 6.3.2.

Let $(f_n)$ be a sequence of diﬀerentiable functions defined on
the closed interval $[a,b]$, and assume $(f'_n)$ converges uniformly on $[a,b]$. If there exists a point $x_0 ∈ [a,b]$ where $f_n(x_0)$ is convergent, then $(f_n)$ converges uniformly on $[a,b]$.

Proof. Exercise 6.3.7.
