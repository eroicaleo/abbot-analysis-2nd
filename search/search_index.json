Solution: Yes. To obtain \\epsilon = \\min \\left\\{ \\epsilon_1, \\cdots, \\epsilon_n \\right\\} > 0 . If there are infinite number of open sets, it's not guaranteed \\epsilon > 0 . So we might not be able to find V_{\\epsilon}(a) . \\square (b) Give an example of a countable collection of open sets \\left\\{ O_1,O_2,O_3, ... \\right\\} whose intersection \\cap_{n=1}^\\infty O_n is closed, not empty and not all of \\mathbb{R} . Solution: Consider O_n = ( -\\frac{1}{n}, \\frac{1}{n} ) , then \\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty}O_n = \\left\\{ 0 \\right\\} which is a non-empty closed set. \\square 3.3.2 Let A = \\left\\{ (-1)^n + \\frac{2}{n} : n = 1, 2, 3 \\right\\} \\text{and } B = \\left\\{ x \\in \\mathbb{Q}: 0 < x < 1 \\right\\} Answer the following questions for each set: (a) What are the limit points? (b) Is the set open? Closed? (c) Does the set contain any isolated points? (d) Find the closure of the set. Solution: The limit points of A are \\left\\{ -1, 1 \\right\\} . For B , it's [0, 1] . Both A and B are neither open nor closed. For A , -1 \\not\\in A . For B , 1 \\not\\in B . All points in A are isolated except 1 . B does not contain any isolated points. \\overline{A} = A \\cup \\left\\{ -1\\right\\} and \\overline{B} = [0, 1] . \\square 3.2.3 Decide whether the following sets are open, closed, or neither. If a set is not open, find a point in the set for which there is no \u03b5-neighborhood contained in the set. If a set is not closed, find a limit point that is not contained in the set. (a) Q. Neither. Every point. \\sqrt{2} . Also see here . (b) \\mathbb{N} Closed. Every point. (c) \\{x \\in R:x \\ne 0\\} \\ Open. 0 . (d) \\{1+1/4+1/9+\\cdots+1/n^2: n \\in N\\} . Neither. Everypoint. It's limit. (e) \\{1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + \\cdots + 1/n : n \\in N\\} . Closed. Everypoint. 3.2.4 Let A be nonempty and bounded above so that s = \\sup A exists. (a) Show that s \u2208 \\overline{A} . Proof: According to Lemma 1.3.8., s is a limited point of A . So s \u2208 \\overline{A} . (b) Can an open set contain its supremum? Proof: No. If V_{\\epsilon}(s) = (s - \\epsilon, s + \\epsilon) \\subset A . Then s < s + \\epsilon/2 \\in A . Then s is not the supremum. We got a contradiction. See also here . 3.2.5 A set F \\subset \\mathbb{R} is closed if and only if every Cauchy sequence contained in F has a limit that is also an element of F . Proof: \\Rightarrow Assume F \\subset \\mathbb{R} is closed, and \\left( a_n \\right) is a Cauchy sequence contained in F . Then according to Theorem 2.6.4 (Cauchy Criterion), \\left( a_n \\right) converges. Let x = \\lim a_n . If \\exists n, \\text{such that } a_n = x , then x \\in F . If x \\neq a_n, \\forall n , then according to Theorem 3.2.5, x is a limit point of F , so x \\in F . \\Leftarrow Assume every Cauchy sequence contained in F has a limit that is also an element of F and x is a limit point of F . According Theorem 3.2.5, we can find some sequence (a_n) contained in F satisfying a_n \\ne x for all n \\in \\mathbb{N} and x = \\lim a_n . Again according to Theorem 2.6.4, (a_n) is a Cauchy sequence, then x \\in F . \\square 3.2.6 Decide whether the following statements are true or false. Provide counterexamples for those that are false, and supply proofs for those that are true. (a) An open set that contains every rational number must necessarily be all of R. No. Consider \\mathbb{R} - \\{\\pi\\} . (b) The Nested Interval Property remains true if the term \u201cclosed interval\u201d is replaced by \u201cclosed set.\u201d False. Let I_n = [n, \\infty) , which is closed. Then \\cap I_n = \\emptyset . See discussion here . But if the \"closed set\" is bounded. Then assume a_n = \\inf I_n, b_n = \\sup I_n . Then we have a_n, b_n \\in I_n . Now let a = \\sup \\{a_n\\} , because a is a limit point of I_n . so a \\in I_n, \\forall n . (c) Every nonempty open set contains a rational number. True. \\mathbb{Q} is dense. (d) Every bounded infinite closed set contains a rational number. False. Consider A = \\{\\pi + (1/n) : n\\in \\mathbb{N} \\} \\cup \\pi . Also see here (e) The Cantor set is closed. True. By definition in section 3.1 C = \\cap_{n=0}^\\infty C_n Each C_n is the union of finite closed set so it is closed from Theorem 3.2.14. Then C is the intersection of them, so it is also closed. 3.2.7 Given A \u2286 R , let L be the set of all limit points of A . (a) Show that the set L is closed. Proof: Assume x is limit point of L, then for every V_{\\epsilon}(x) , we can find x' \\in L and x' \\in V_{\\epsilon}(x) . Then x' is a limit point of A , so we can find a \\in A , such that a \\in V_{\\epsilon}(x) . The x itself is a limited point of A . So x \\in L . So L is closed. (b) Argue that if x is a limit point of A \\cup L , then x is a limit point of A . Use this observation to furnish a proof for Theorem 3.2.12. Proof. If l \\in L and l \\in V_{\\epsilon}(x) , then we can find a \\in V_{\\epsilon'}(l) \\subset V_{\\epsilon}(x) . So l is a limit point of A . Then l \\in L \\subseteq A \\cup L . Then A \\cup L is closed. 3.2.8 Assume A is an open set and B is a closed set. Determine if the following sets are definitely open, definitely closed, both, or neither. (a) \\overline{A\u222aB} Definitely closed. (b) A - B= \\{x\u2208A:x \\notin B\\} Definitely open. Assume x \\in A - B , then x \\notin B , so x is not a limit point of B . Then we can find V_{\\epsilon_1}(x) \\cap B = \\emptyset . Since A is open, we can find V_{\\epsilon_2}(x) \\subset A . So we can find \\epsilon = \\min(\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_2) such that V_{\\epsilon}(x) \\in A - B . (c) (A^c \u222a B)^c A^c is closed, then (A^c \u222a B) is closed. Then (A^c \u222a B)^c is open. (d) (A\u2229B)\u222a(A^c \u2229B) It's equal to B , so closed. (e) \\overline{A}^c \u2229 \\overline{A^c} We prove \\overline{A^c} \\supset \\overline{A}^c . Assume a \\in \\overline{A}^c , then a \\notin \\overline{A} so a \\notin A , then a \\in A^c \\subset \\overline{A^c} . So \\overline{A}^c \\subset \\overline{A^c} . Then \\overline{A}^c \u2229 \\overline{A^c} = \\overline{A^c} . Then it is definitely closed. 3.2.10 Only one of the following three descriptions can be realized. Provide an example that illustrates the viable description, and explain why the other two cannot exist. (i) A countable set contained in [0, 1] with no limit points. This is not possible because of Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem. (ii) A countable set contained in [0, 1] with no isolated points. This is possible for \\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0, 1] . (iii) A set with an uncountable number of isolated points. Proof: This is impossible. Assume A is such set, x is an isolated points, such that V_{\\epsilon}(x) \\cap A =\\{x\\} . We will show we can find V_{\\epsilon_1}(x) does not intersect with any V_{\\epsilon_y}(y) . Assume V_{\\epsilon}(x) \\cap V_{\\epsilon_y}(y) \\ne \\emptyset and y > x . First we will show V_{\\epsilon}(x) \\cap V_{\\epsilon_z}(z) = \\emptyset, \\forall z > x . If this is not the case, and y > z , then z \\in V_{\\epsilon_y}(y) or z \\in V_{\\epsilon}(x) . This is not possible. If z > y , then y \\in V_{\\epsilon_z}(z) . This is also not possible. The same argument holds for y < x . So we can shrink V_{\\epsilon}(x) small enough. And this can be performed for any x \\in A . That means we have an uncountable set of open set and any two of them does not intersect with each other. But that means we can have uncountable many rational numbers. We have a contradiction. \\square Also search this question in stack overflow, like here 3.2.11 (a) Prove that \\overline{A \u222a B} = \\overline{A} \u222a \\overline{B} . Proof: We first prove \\overline{A \u222a B} \\subset \\overline{A} \u222a \\overline{B} . A \\subset \\overline{A} \u222a \\overline{B} and B \\subset \\overline{A} \u222a \\overline{B} , so A \u222a B \\subset \\overline{A} \u222a \\overline{B} . Because \\overline{A} \u222a \\overline{B} is also a closed set, it must contain the closure of A \u222a B according to Theorem 3.2.12. So \\overline{A \u222a B} \\subset \\overline{A} \u222a \\overline{B} . On the other hand, A \\subset \\overline{A \u222a B} so \\overline{A} \\subset \\overline{A \u222a B} . For the same reason, \\overline{B} \\subset \\overline{A \u222a B} . So \\overline{A} \u222a \\overline{B} \\subset \\overline{A \u222a B} . So we have \\overline{A \u222a B} = \\overline{A} \u222a \\overline{B} . \\square (b) Does this result about closures extend to infinite unions of sets? Proof: No. Consider A_1 = [1/2, 1], ..., A_n = [1/(n+1), 1/n] . Then \\cup \\overline{A_n} = (0, 1] . However \\cup A_n = (0, 1] , so \\overline{\\cup A_n} = [0, 1] . 3.2.12 Let A be an uncountable set and let B be the set of real numbers that divides A into two uncountable sets; that is, s \u2208 B if both \\{x : x\u2208A \\text{ and } x<s\\} and \\{x:x\u2208A \\text{ and } x>s\\} are uncountable. Show B is nonempty and open. Proof: Define C_s = (-\\infty, s] and C = \\left\\{ s : A \\cap C_s \\text{ is countable} \\right\\} . We can see C \\ne \\mathbb{R} . Otherwise, A = \\cup_{i = 1}^{\\infty} (A \\cap C_i) is countable. This means C is upper bounded. Let c = \\sup C , we will show c \\in C . A \\cap C_c = \\cup_{i = 1}^{\\infty} (A \\cap C_{c-\\frac{1}{i}}) \\cup (A \\cap \\left\\{ c \\right\\} ) is countable. So c \\in C . Furthurmore C = (-\\infty, c] . Similarly, define D_s = [s, \\infty) and D = \\left\\{ s : A \\cap D_s \\text{ is countable} \\right\\} . We can show D = [d, \\infty) for some d . Furthur more C \\cap D = \\emptyset . Otherwise A is countable. So finally, we have B = (c, d) is nonempty and open. 3.2.13 Prove that the only sets that are both open and closed are \\mathbb{R} and the empty set \\emptyset . Proof: Consider a \\in A \\ne \\emptyset and b \\in A^c \\ne \\emptyset . WLOG, assume a < b . Let A' = A \\cap [a, b] . Since the intersection of 2 closed sets are closed, A' is closed. Let s = \\sup A' . since A' is closed, s \\in A' (Exercise 3.2.4). b is an upper bound of A' , so s \\leq b . If s = b , then s \\in A^c . We have a contradiction. If s < b , since A is open, there exists V_{\\epsilon}(s) \\subset A \\cap [a, b] = A' , then s is not a superem of A' . We have another contradiction. \\square Also see stackexchange here . 3.2.14 A dual notion to the closure of a set is the interior of a set. The interior of E is denoted E^o and is defined as E^o = \\{x \\in E: \\text{there exists } V_{\\epsilon}(x)\u2286E \\}. a. Show that E is closed if and only if E=\\overline{E} . Show that E is open if and only if E^o = E . Proof: E is closed so it contains all its limited points, i.e. L \\subset E , so E \\supset E \\cup L = \\overline{E} . On the other hand, E \\subset \\overline{E} . So E = \\overline{E} . E is open, so if x \\in E then there exists V_{\\epsilon}(x) \\subseteq E . so x \\in E^o , and E \\subseteq E^o . On the other hand, E \\supseteq E^o . So E = E^o . \\square b. Show that \\overline{E}^c = (E^c)^o , and similarly that (E^o)^c = \\overline{E^c} . Proof: First statement. Assume x \\in \\overline{E}^c , then x \\notin \\overline{E} . Then x \\notin E , so x \\in E^c . Furthermore x is not a limit point of E , so there exists V_{\\epsilon}(x)\u2286 E^c . Then x \\in (E^c)^o . On the other hand if x \\in (E^c)^o , then there exists V_{\\epsilon}(x)\u2286 E^c . So x \\notin \\overline{E} , so x \\in \\overline{E}^c . Second statement. Assume x \\in (E^o)^c , then x \\notin E^o . Then x is a limit point of E^c , so x \\in \\overline{E^c} . On the other hand, assume x \\in \\overline{E^c} . If x \\in E^c , then x \\in (E^o)^c . If x \\notin E^c , x is a limit point of E^c . So there doesn't exist V_{\\epsilon}(x)\u2286 E , then x \\notin E^o . So x \\in (E^o)^c . \\square 3.2.15 A set A is called an F_\u03c3 set if it can be written as the countable union of closed sets. A set B is called a G_\u03b4 set if it can be written as the countable intersection of open sets. (a) Show that a closed interval [a, b] is a G_\u03b4 set. Proof: Let A_n = (a - 1/n, b + 1/n) . Then [a,b] = \\cap_{i = 1}^{\\infty} A_n . (b) Show that the half-open interval (a, b] is both a G_\u03b4 and an F_\u03c3 set. Proof: Let A_n = [a+\\frac{1}{n}, b] , then (a, b] is F_\u03c3 . Let B_n = (a, b+\\frac{1}{n}) , then (a, b] is G_\u03b4 . (c) Show that Q is an F_\u03c3 set, and the set of irrationals I forms a G_\u03b4 set. Proof: Let A_q = \\{q\\} . Then it's a closed set. Since Q is countable, the union of them is Q . Let B_q = R - \\{q\\} , then B_q is open. The intersection of them is I . \\square","title":"Chapter 03 Exercises"},{"location":"ch03ex/#chapter-03-basic-topology-of-mathbbr","text":"","title":"Chapter 03 Basic Topology of \\mathbb{R}"},{"location":"ch03ex/#32-open-and-closed-sets","text":"","title":"3.2 Open and Closed Sets"},{"location":"ch03ex/#321","text":"(a) Where in the proof of Theorem 3.2.3 part (ii) does the assumption that the collection of open sets be finite get used?
