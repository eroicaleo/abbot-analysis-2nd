Solution: Yes. To obtain \\epsilon = \\min \\left\\{ \\epsilon_1, \\cdots, \\epsilon_n \\right\\} > 0 . If there are infinite number of open sets, it's not guaranteed \\epsilon > 0 . So we might not be able to find V_{\\epsilon}(a) . \\square (b) Give an example of a countable collection of open sets \\left\\{ O_1,O_2,O_3, ... \\right\\} whose intersection \\cap_{n=1}^\\infty O_n is closed, not empty and not all of \\mathbb{R} . Solution: Consider O_n = ( -\\frac{1}{n}, \\frac{1}{n} ) , then \\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty}O_n = \\left\\{ 0 \\right\\} which is a non-empty closed set. \\square 3.3.2 Let A = \\left\\{ (-1)^n + \\frac{2}{n} : n = 1, 2, 3 \\right\\} \\text{and } B = \\left\\{ x \\in \\mathbb{Q}: 0 < x < 1 \\right\\} Answer the following questions for each set: (a) What are the limit points? (b) Is the set open? Closed? (c) Does the set contain any isolated points? (d) Find the closure of the set. Solution: The limit points of A are \\left\\{ -1, 1 \\right\\} . For B , it's [0, 1] . Both A and B are neither open nor closed. For A , -1 \\not\\in A . For B , 1 \\not\\in B . All points in A are isolated except 1 . B does not contain any isolated points. \\overline{A} = A \\cup \\left\\{ -1\\right\\} and \\overline{B} = [0, 1] . \\square 3.2.3 Decide whether the following sets are open, closed, or neither. If a set is not open, find a point in the set for which there is no \u03b5-neighborhood contained in the set. If a set is not closed, find a limit point that is not contained in the set. (a) Q. Neither. Every point. \\sqrt{2} . Also see here . (b) \\mathbb{N} Closed. Every point. (c) \\{x \\in R:x \\ne 0\\} \\ Open. 0 . (d) \\{1+1/4+1/9+\\cdots+1/n^2: n \\in N\\} . Neither. Everypoint. It's limit. (e) \\{1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + \\cdots + 1/n : n \\in N\\} . Closed. Everypoint. 3.2.4 Let A be nonempty and bounded above so that s = \\sup A exists. (a) Show that s \u2208 \\overline{A} . Proof: According to Lemma 1.3.8., s is a limited point of A . So s \u2208 \\overline{A} . (b) Can an open set contain its supremum? Proof: No. If V_{\\epsilon}(s) = (s - \\epsilon, s + \\epsilon) \\subset A . Then s < s + \\epsilon/2 \\in A . Then s is not the supremum. We got a contradiction. See also here . 3.2.5 A set F \\subset \\mathbb{R} is closed if and only if every Cauchy sequence contained in F has a limit that is also an element of F . Proof: \\Rightarrow Assume F \\subset \\mathbb{R} is closed, and \\left( a_n \\right) is a Cauchy sequence contained in F . Then according to Theorem 2.6.4 (Cauchy Criterion), \\left( a_n \\right) converges. Let x = \\lim a_n . If \\exists n, \\text{such that } a_n = x , then x \\in F . If x \\neq a_n, \\forall n , then according to Theorem 3.2.5, x is a limit point of F , so x \\in F . \\Leftarrow Assume every Cauchy sequence contained in F has a limit that is also an element of F and x is a limit point of F . According Theorem 3.2.5, we can find some sequence (a_n) contained in F satisfying a_n \\ne x for all n \\in \\mathbb{N} and x = \\lim a_n . Again according to Theorem 2.6.4, (a_n) is a Cauchy sequence, then x \\in F . \\square 3.2.6 Decide whether the following statements are true or false. Provide counterexamples for those that are false, and supply proofs for those that are true. (a) An open set that contains every rational number must necessarily be all of R. No. Consider \\mathbb{R} - \\{\\pi\\} . (b) The Nested Interval Property remains true if the term \u201cclosed interval\u201d is replaced by \u201cclosed set.\u201d False. Let I_n = [n, \\infty) , which is closed. Then \\cap I_n = \\emptyset . See discussion here . But if the \"closed set\" is bounded. Then assume a_n = \\inf I_n, b_n = \\sup I_n . Then we have a_n, b_n \\in I_n . Now let a = \\sup \\{a_n\\} , because a is a limit point of I_n . so a \\in I_n, \\forall n . (c) Every nonempty open set contains a rational number. True. \\mathbb{Q} is dense. (d) Every bounded infinite closed set contains a rational number. False. Consider A = \\{\\pi + (1/n) : n\\in \\mathbb{N} \\} \\cup \\pi . Also see here (e) The Cantor set is closed. True. By definition in section 3.1 C = \\cap_{n=0}^\\infty C_n Each C_n is the union of finite closed set so it is closed from Theorem 3.2.14. Then C is the intersection of them, so it is also closed. 3.2.7 Given A \u2286 R , let L be the set of all limit points of A . (a) Show that the set L is closed. Proof: Assume x is limit point of L, then for every V_{\\epsilon}(x) , we can find x' \\in L and x' \\in V_{\\epsilon}(x) . Then x' is a limit point of A , so we can find a \\in A , such that a \\in V_{\\epsilon}(x) . The x itself is a limited point of A . So x \\in L . So L is closed. (b) Argue that if x is a limit point of A \\cup L , then x is a limit point of A . Use this observation to furnish a proof for Theorem 3.2.12. Proof. If l \\in L and l \\in V_{\\epsilon}(x) , then we can find a \\in V_{\\epsilon'}(l) \\subset V_{\\epsilon}(x) . So l is a limit point of A . Then l \\in L \\subseteq A \\cup L . Then A \\cup L is closed. 3.2.8 Assume A is an open set and B is a closed set. Determine if the following sets are definitely open, definitely closed, both, or neither. (a) \\overline{A\u222aB} Definitely closed. (b) A - B= \\{x\u2208A:x \\notin B\\} Definitely open. Assume x \\in A - B , then x \\notin B , so x is not a limit point of B . Then we can find V_{\\epsilon_1}(x) \\cap B = \\emptyset . Since A is open, we can find V_{\\epsilon_2}(x) \\subset A . So we can find \\epsilon = \\min(\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_2) such that V_{\\epsilon}(x) \\in A - B . (c) (A^c \u222a B)^c A^c is closed, then (A^c \u222a B) is closed. Then (A^c \u222a B)^c is open. (d) (A\u2229B)\u222a(A^c \u2229B) It's equal to B , so closed. (e) \\overline{A}^c \u2229 \\overline{A^c} We prove \\overline{A^c} \\supset \\overline{A}^c . Assume a \\in \\overline{A}^c , then a \\notin \\overline{A} so a \\notin A , then a \\in A^c \\subset \\overline{A^c} . So \\overline{A}^c \\subset \\overline{A^c} . Then \\overline{A}^c \u2229 \\overline{A^c} = \\overline{A^c} . Then it is definitely closed. 3.2.10 Only one of the following three descriptions can be realized. Provide an example that illustrates the viable description, and explain why the other two cannot exist. (i) A countable set contained in [0, 1] with no limit points. This is not possible because of Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem. (ii) A countable set contained in [0, 1] with no isolated points. This is possible for \\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0, 1] . (iii) A set with an uncountable number of isolated points. Proof: This is impossible. Assume A is such set, x is an isolated points, such that V_{\\epsilon}(x) \\cap A =\\{x\\} . We will show we can find V_{\\epsilon_1}(x) does not intersect with any V_{\\epsilon_y}(y) . Assume V_{\\epsilon}(x) \\cap V_{\\epsilon_y}(y) \\ne \\emptyset and y > x . First we will show V_{\\epsilon}(x) \\cap V_{\\epsilon_z}(z) = \\emptyset, \\forall z > x . If this is not the case, and y > z , then z \\in V_{\\epsilon_y}(y) or z \\in V_{\\epsilon}(x) . This is not possible. If z > y , then y \\in V_{\\epsilon_z}(z) . This is also not possible. The same argument holds for y < x . So we can shrink V_{\\epsilon}(x) small enough. And this can be performed for any x \\in A . That means we have an uncountable set of open set and any two of them does not intersect with each other. But that means we can have uncountable many rational numbers. We have a contradiction. \\square Also search this question in stack overflow, like here 3.2.11 (a) Prove that \\overline{A \u222a B} = \\overline{A} \u222a \\overline{B} . Proof: We first prove \\overline{A \u222a B} \\subset \\overline{A} \u222a \\overline{B} . A \\subset \\overline{A} \u222a \\overline{B} and B \\subset \\overline{A} \u222a \\overline{B} , so A \u222a B \\subset \\overline{A} \u222a \\overline{B} . Because \\overline{A} \u222a \\overline{B} is also a closed set, it must contain the closure of A \u222a B according to Theorem 3.2.12. So \\overline{A \u222a B} \\subset \\overline{A} \u222a \\overline{B} . On the other hand, A \\subset \\overline{A \u222a B} so \\overline{A} \\subset \\overline{A \u222a B} . For the same reason, \\overline{B} \\subset \\overline{A \u222a B} . So \\overline{A} \u222a \\overline{B} \\subset \\overline{A \u222a B} . So we have \\overline{A \u222a B} = \\overline{A} \u222a \\overline{B} . \\square (b) Does this result about closures extend to infinite unions of sets? Proof: No. Consider A_1 = [1/2, 1], ..., A_n = [1/(n+1), 1/n] . Then \\cup \\overline{A_n} = (0, 1] . However \\cup A_n = (0, 1] , so \\overline{\\cup A_n} = [0, 1] . 3.2.12 Let A be an uncountable set and let B be the set of real numbers that divides A into two uncountable sets; that is, s \u2208 B if both \\{x : x\u2208A \\text{ and } x<s\\} and \\{x:x\u2208A \\text{ and } x>s\\} are uncountable. Show B is nonempty and open. Proof: Define C_s = (-\\infty, s] and C = \\left\\{ s : A \\cap C_s \\text{ is countable} \\right\\} . We can see C \\ne \\mathbb{R} . Otherwise, A = \\cup_{i = 1}^{\\infty} (A \\cap C_i) is countable. This means C is upper bounded. Let c = \\sup C , we will show c \\in C . A \\cap C_c = \\cup_{i = 1}^{\\infty} (A \\cap C_{c-\\frac{1}{i}}) \\cup (A \\cap \\left\\{ c \\right\\} ) is countable. So c \\in C . Furthurmore C = (-\\infty, c] . Similarly, define D_s = [s, \\infty) and D = \\left\\{ s : A \\cap D_s \\text{ is countable} \\right\\} . We can show D = [d, \\infty) for some d . Furthur more C \\cap D = \\emptyset . Otherwise A is countable. So finally, we have B = (c, d) is nonempty and open. 3.2.13 Prove that the only sets that are both open and closed are \\mathbb{R} and the empty set \\emptyset . Proof: Consider a \\in A \\ne \\emptyset and b \\in A^c \\ne \\emptyset . WLOG, assume a < b . Let A' = A \\cap [a, b] . Since the intersection of 2 closed sets are closed, A' is closed. Let s = \\sup A' . since A' is closed, s \\in A' (Exercise 3.2.4). b is an upper bound of A' , so s \\leq b . If s = b , then s \\in A^c . We have a contradiction. If s < b , since A is open, there exists V_{\\epsilon}(s) \\subset A \\cap [a, b] = A' , then s is not a superem of A' . We have another contradiction. \\square Also see stackexchange here . 3.2.14 A dual notion to the closure of a set is the interior of a set. The interior of E is denoted E^o and is defined as E^o = \\{x \\in E: \\text{there exists } V_{\\epsilon}(x)\u2286E \\}. a. Show that E is closed if and only if E=\\overline{E} . Show that E is open if and only if E^o = E . Proof: E is closed so it contains all its limited points, i.e. L \\subset E , so E \\supset E \\cup L = \\overline{E} . On the other hand, E \\subset \\overline{E} . So E = \\overline{E} . E is open, so if x \\in E then there exists V_{\\epsilon}(x) \\subseteq E . so x \\in E^o , and E \\subseteq E^o . On the other hand, E \\supseteq E^o . So E = E^o . \\square b. Show that \\overline{E}^c = (E^c)^o , and similarly that (E^o)^c = \\overline{E^c} . Proof: First statement. Assume x \\in \\overline{E}^c , then x \\notin \\overline{E} . Then x \\notin E , so x \\in E^c . Furthermore x is not a limit point of E , so there exists V_{\\epsilon}(x)\u2286 E^c . Then x \\in (E^c)^o . On the other hand if x \\in (E^c)^o , then there exists V_{\\epsilon}(x)\u2286 E^c . So x \\notin \\overline{E} , so x \\in \\overline{E}^c . Second statement. Assume x \\in (E^o)^c , then x \\notin E^o . Then x is a limit point of E^c , so x \\in \\overline{E^c} . On the other hand, assume x \\in \\overline{E^c} . If x \\in E^c , then x \\in (E^o)^c . If x \\notin E^c , x is a limit point of E^c . So there doesn't exist V_{\\epsilon}(x)\u2286 E , then x \\notin E^o . So x \\in (E^o)^c . \\square 3.2.15 A set A is called an F_\u03c3 set if it can be written as the countable union of closed sets. A set B is called a G_\u03b4 set if it can be written as the countable intersection of open sets. (a) Show that a closed interval [a, b] is a G_\u03b4 set. Proof: Let A_n = (a - 1/n, b + 1/n) . Then [a,b] = \\cap_{i = 1}^{\\infty} A_n . (b) Show that the half-open interval (a, b] is both a G_\u03b4 and an F_\u03c3 set. Proof: Let A_n = [a+\\frac{1}{n}, b] , then (a, b] is F_\u03c3 . Let B_n = (a, b+\\frac{1}{n}) , then (a, b] is G_\u03b4 . (c) Show that Q is an F_\u03c3 set, and the set of irrationals I forms a G_\u03b4 set. Proof: Let A_q = \\{q\\} . Then it's a closed set. Since Q is countable, the union of them is Q . Let B_q = R - \\{q\\} , then B_q is open. The intersection of them is I . \\square 3.3 Compact Sets 3.3.1 Show that if K is compact and nonempty, then \\sup K and \\inf K both exist and are elements of K . Proof: Since K is compact, then it's bounded and closed. So \\sup K and \\inf K both exist. Because it's closed. According to Exercise 3.2.4., \\sup K \\in S, \\inf K \\in S . 3.3.2 Decide which of the following sets are compact. For those that are not compact, show how Definition 3.3.1 breaks down. In other words, give an example of a sequence contained in the given set that does not possess a subsequence converging to a limit in the set. (a) N. Not compact. Itself. (b) Q \\cap [0,1] Not compact. A sequence converges to \\sqrt{2}/2 . (c) The Cantor set. Compact. Close and bounded. (d) \\{1+1/2^2 +1/3^2 +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+1/n^2 :n\u2208N\\} . Not closed. Itself. (e) \\{1,1/2,2/3,3/4,4/5,...\\}. Compact. Closed and bounded. It has 1 limit point which is 1, so it's closed. 3.3.3 Prove the converse of Theorem 3.3.4 by showing that if a set K \u2286 R is closed and bounded, then it is compact. Proof: If K is closed and bounded. And (a_n) is a sequence in K . Then since (a_n) is bounded, according to Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass Theorem, there is a subsequence a_{n_k} \\rightarrow x . Then x is a limit point of K , then x \\in K . 3.3.4 Assume K is compact and F is closed. Decide if the following sets are definitely compact, definitely closed, both, or neither. (a) K \\cap F Proof: It's compact. K is bounded, so K \\cap F is also bounded. And it's also closed. So it's compact. (b) \\overline{F^c \\cup K^c} Proof: It's closed not compact. F^c is unbounded. (c) \\left\\{ K \\backslash F = { x \u2208 K : x \\notin F } \\right\\} Proof: It can be neither, e.g. let K = [-1, 1] and F = [0, \\infty] . (d) \\overline{K \\cap F^c} Proof: It's compact. K \\cap F^c \\subseteq K , so \\overline{K \\cap F^c} \\subseteq K . So it's bounded closed set. 3.3.5 Decide whether the following propositions are true or false. If the claim is valid, supply a short proof, and if the claim is false, provide a counterexample. (a) The arbitrary intersection of compact sets is compact. Proof: True. compact set is closed and bounded. The arbitrary intersection of closed set is closed. The arbitrary intersection of bounded set is bounded. So it's closed and bounded. As long as it's not empty, then it's compact. (b) The arbitrary union of compact sets is compact. Proof: False. counterexample. Let A_n = [n, n+1] . (c) Let A be arbitrary, and let K be compact. Then, the intersection A \u2229 K is compact. Proof: False. Let A = (0, 1), K = [0, 1] . (d) If F1 \u2287 F2 \u2287 F3 \u2287 F4 \u2287 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 is a nested sequence of nonempty closed sets, then the intersection \\cap_{n=1}^{\\infty} F_n \\not= \\emptyset . Proof: False. Let F_n = [n, \\infty) . 3.3.6 This exercise is meant to illustrate the point made in the opening paragraph to Section 3.3. Verify that the following three statements are true if every blank is filled in with the word \u201cfinite.\u201d Which are true if every blank is filled in with the word \u201ccompact\u201d? Which are true if every blank is filled in with the word \u201cclosed\u201d? (a) Every finite set has a maximum. True. Every compact set has a maximum. True. Bounded and closed. Exercise 3.2.4. Every closed set has a maximum. False. [0, \\infty) . (b) If A and B are finite, then A+B={a+b:a\u2208A,b\u2208B} is also finite. True. If A and B are compact, then A+B={a+b:a\u2208A,b\u2208B} is also compact. True. proof: Assume c is a limit point of A+B , we can find a sequence \\{a_n + b_n\\} \\rightarrow c . For \\{a_n\\} , since A is compact, we can find a subsequence \\{a_{n_k}\\} \\rightarrow a \\in A . Again \\{a_{n_k} + b_{n_k}\\} \\rightarrow c . We can find a subsequence b_{n_{k_l}} \\rightarrow b . So a_{n_{k_l}} + b_{n_{k_l}} \\rightarrow c and a_{n_{k_l}} + b_{n_{k_l}} \\rightarrow a + b . So c = a + b . So c \\in A+B . See also here If A and B are closed, then A+B={a+b:a\u2208A,b\u2208B} is also closed. False. Consdier A = \\{n + \\frac{1}{10^n}: n = 1, 2, \\cdots\\} \\\\ B = \\{-n : n = 1, 2, \\cdots\\} Both sets are closed. And 0 is a limit point of A+B . And 0 \\notin A+B . See also here . (c) If \\{A_n: n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} is a collection of finite sets with the property that every finite subcollection has a nonempty intersection, the \\cap A_n \\ne \\emptyset . Proof: This is true. Assume otherwise. Consider B_n = \\cap_{i=1}^n A_n Consider a_1 \\in A_1 = B_1 , since a_1 \\notin \\cap A_n = \\cap B_n , we can find N_1 , such that a \\notin B_n, \\forall n > N_1 . We can check for all elements in a_i \\in A_1 and find N_{i} for each a_i . Then we choose N = \\max \\left\\{ N_1, N_2, \\dots \\right\\} . Then for any n > N, a_i \\not\\in B_n . B_n is empty. This contradicts to every finite subcollection has a nonempty intersection. So this statement is true. \\square If \\{A_n: n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} is a collection of compact sets with the property that every finite subcollection has a nonempty intersection, the \\cap A_n \\ne \\emptyset . Proof: This is true. Again consider B_n = \\cap_{i=1}^n A_n Then we have B_1 \\supseteq B_2 \\supseteq \\dots They are all compact. So from Theorem 3.3.5 (Nested Compact Set Property), A is not empty. If \\{A_n: n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} is a collection of closed sets with the property that every finite subcollection has a nonempty intersection, then \\cap A_n \\ne \\emptyset . Proof: False. Consider A_n = [n, \\infty) . 3.3.7 As some more evidence of the surprising nature of the Cantor set, follow these steps to show that the sum C +C = \\{x+y : x,y \u2208 C\\} is equal to the closed interval [0, 2] . (Keep in mind that C has zero length and contains no intervals.) Because C \u2286 [0,1], C + C \u2286 [0,2] , so we only need to prove the reverse inclusion [0,2] \u2286 \\{x + y : x,y \u2208 C\\} . Thus, given s \u2208 [0,2] , we must find two elements x,y\u2208C satisfying x+y=s . (a) Show that there exist x_1 , y_1 \u2208 C1 for which x_1 + y_1 = s . Show in general that, for an arbitrary n \u2208 N , we can always find x_n,y_n \u2208 C_n for which x_n + y_n = s . Proof: Let's start with C_0 = [0, 1] . Given any s in [0,2] , choose any x_0, y_0 such that s = x_0 + y_0 . So how do we find x_1, y_1 \\in C_1 such that s = x_1 + y_1 ? We distinguish the following cases: If both x_0, y_0 are in [0, 1/3] or [2/3, 1] then let x_1 = x_0 \\in C_1 and y_1 = y_0 \\in C_1 . If none of x_0, y_0 are in [0, 1/3] or [2/3, 1] , then it means x_0, y_0 \\in (1/3, 2/3) . Then lets x_1 = x_0 - 1/3 \\in [0, 1/3] \\subset C_1 and y_1 = y_0 + 1/3 \\in [2/3, 1] \\subset C_1 . If x_0 \\in [0, 1/3] and y_0 \\in (1/3, 2/3) . Then let c_l = x_0 - 0, c_r = 1/3 - x_0 and d_l = y_0 - 1/3, d_r = 2/3 - y_0 . if c_l \\geq d_r , then let x_1 = x_0 - d_r \\in [0, 1/3] , y_1 = y_0 + d_r = 2/3 \\in [2/3, 1] , then x_1, y_1 \\in C_1 . if c_l < d_r , then c_r >= d_l . Then let x_1 = x_0 + d_l \\in [0, 1/3] and y_1 = y_0 - d_r = 1/3 \\in [0, 1/3] . So x_1, y_1 \\in C_1 . Similar argument can be applied when x_0 \\in [2/3, 1] and y_0 \\in (1/3, 2/3) . In conclusion, we proved we can find there exist x_1 , y_1 \u2208 C1 for which x_1 + y_1 = s . Use induction and the similar argument, we can show for an arbitrary n \u2208 N , we can always find x_n,y_n \u2208 C_n for which x_n + y_n = s . \\square (b) Keeping in mind that the sequences (x_n) and (y_n) do not necessarily converge, show how they can nevertheless be used to produce the desired x and y in C satisfying x + y = s . Proof: Assume x_n \\in C_n and x_n \\in I_n . |I_n| = 1/3^n . Using the method in (a) to find x_{n+1} , we know x_{n+1} \\in I_n , and it's either in the left 1/3 or in the right 1/3 part of I_n , call it I_{n+1} . Then we produce I_1 \\supset I_2 \\supset \\dots , such that x_n \\in I_n . According to NIP, there exists x in all of them, that's (x_n) converge to. Next, we prove x \\in C . Because x_1, x_2, \\dots \\in I_1 which is closed, so x \\in I_1 . For the same reason, x \\in I_n \\subset C_n, \\forall n . So x \\in C . Simiarly, we can find the y we need. Finally, we also have x + y = \\lim x_n + \\lim y_n = \\lim (x_n + y_n) = s . \\square See also the stackoverflow discussion . 3.3.8 Let K and L be nonempty compact sets, and define d = \\inf \\{ |x \u2212 y| : x \u2208 K \\text{ and } y \u2208 L \\}. This turns out to be a reasonable definition for the distance between K and L . (a) If K and L are disjoint,show d>0 and that d=|x_0\u2212y_0| for some x_0 \u2208K and y_0 \u2208 L . Proof: Consider sequence x_n - y_n \\rightarrow d , since K and L are compact, we can find subsequence \\{x_{n_k}\\} \\rightarrow x , from there we can find another subsequence \\{y_{n_{k_{l}} }\\} \\rightarrow y , then x - y = d . Since x \\in X and y \\in Y , then x - y \\ne 0 . (b) Show that it\u2019s possible to have d = 0 if we assume only that the disjoint sets K and L are closed. Consider K = \\{1-\\frac{1}{10}, 2-\\frac{1}{100},\\dots\\} \\\\ L = \\{1, 2, \\dots\\} Then the distance can be 0. See also two stackexchange discussions: Q&A 1 Q&A 2 3.3.9 Follow these steps to prove the final implication in Theorem 3.3.8. Assume K satisfies (i) and (ii), and let \\left\\{ O_{\\lambda}(x) : \\lambda \\in \\Lambda \\right\\} be an open cover for K . For contradiction, let\u2019s assume that no finite subcover exists. Let I_0 be a closed interval containing K . (a) Show that there exists a nested sequence of closed intervals I_0 \\supseteq I_1 \\supseteq I_2 \\cdots with the property that, for each n , I_n \\cap K cannot be finitely covered and \\lim |I_0| = 0 . Proof: Because I_0 \\cap K = K , so I_0 \\cap K cannot be finitely covered. Let I_0 = [a_0, b_0] . Now consider [a_0, (a_0+b_0)/2] and [(a_0+b_0)/2, b_0] . One of them intersecting with K must not be finitely covered. So we found I_1 . We can continue this process to find I_n . They satisfy the property. \\square (b) Argue that there exists an x \u2208 K such that x \u2208 I_n for all n . Proof: I_n \\cap K is non empty since it cannot be finitely covered. It is also closed set since both I_0 and K are closed. Then based on Theorem 3.3.5 (Nested Compact Set Property), the intersection is non-empty. \\square (c) Because x \u2208 K , there must exist an open set O_{\\lambda_0} from the original collection that contains x as an element. Explain how this leads to the desired contradiction. Proof: Since O_{\\lambda_0} covers x , we can find V_{\\epsilon}(x) \\subset O_{\\lambda_0} . Then as long as |I_n| < \\epsilon/2 , I_n is covered by V_{\\epsilon}(x) \\subset O_{\\lambda_0} . However, I_n cannot be finitely covered. We have a contradiction. \\square 3.3.10 Here is an alternate proof to the one given in Exercise 3.3.9 for the final implication in the Heine\u2013Borel Theorem. Consider the special case where K is a closed interval. Let \\{O_\u03bb : \u03bb \u2208 \u039b\\} be an open cover for [a,b] and define S to be the set of all x \u2208 [a,b] such that [a,x] has a finite subcover from \\{O_\u03bb : \u03bb \u2208 \u039b\\} . (a) Argue that S is nonempty and bounded, and thus s = \\sup S exists. Proof. Consider a is cover by O_a , then we can find V_{\\epsilon}(a) \\subset O_a , then [a, a+\\epsilon/2] \\subset V_{\\epsilon}(a) . So S is nonempty. Furthermore, we will prove s \\in S . Assume O_s covers s . Then we can find V_{\\epsilon}(s) \\subset O_s , the [s, s-\\epsilon/2] \\subset V_{\\epsilon}(s) . And [a, s-\\epsilon/2] has a finite subcover. So [a, s] has a finite subcover. \\square (b) Now show s = b , which implies [a, b] has a finite subcover. Proof. Assume s = c < b . Then c is covered by O_c . Since O_c is open, then we can find c < c' \\in O_c , then [a, c'] has a finite subcover. We have a contradiction. \\square (c) Finally, prove the theorem for an arbitrary closed and bounded set K . Proof. Since K is bounded, then we can assume K \\subseteq [a,b] . Assume O_\\lambda is an open cover of K . And assume c \\notin K, c \\in [a,b] . Since K is closed, we know c is not a limit point of K . Then we can find V_{\\epsilon}(c) \\cap K = \\emptyset . This way, we can construct an open cover of [a, b] , i.e O_\\lambda \\cup V_{\\epsilon}(c) . Then we can find a finite cover. From that finite cover, we can find a sub finite cover which is in O_\\lambda . \\square 3.3.11 Consider each of the sets listed in Exercise 3.3.2. For each one that is not compact, find an open cover for which there is no finite subcover. (a) N. (n-1/2, n+1/2) (b) Q \\cap [0,1] (q-\\epsilon/2, q+\\epsilon/2) where \\epsilon is distance between q and \\sqrt{2}/2 . (d) \\{1+1/2^2 +1/3^2 +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+1/n^2 :n\u2208N\\} . Let a_n = 1+1/2^2 +1/3^2 +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+1/n^2 and let O_n = (a-1/2(n+1)^2, a+ 1/2(n+1)^2) 3.3.12 Using the concept of open covers (and explicitly avoiding the Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass Theorem), prove that every bounded infinite set has a limit point. Proof: We use contradiction. Assume K is a bounded infinite set, and K \\subset [a, b] . Assume K has no limit point. Since none of the point in [a,b] is a limit point of K . Then for any x \\in [a,b] , we can find V_{\u03b5}(x) \\cap K = \\{x\\} . Then we can find a finite cover of [a,b] , which is also a finite cover of K . So K is finite. See also here 3.3.13 Let\u2019s call a set clompact if it has the property that every closed cover (i.e., a cover consisting of closed sets) admits a finite subcover. Describe all of the clompact subsets of R . Solution: all clompact are finite set. Because one point set \\{x\\} is a closed set. See also here 3.4 Perfect Sets and Connected Sets 3.4.1 If P is a perfect set and K is compact, is the intersection P \\cap K always compact? Always perfect? Proof: It's always compact. Bounded and closed. Let P = [0, 1] and K = \\left\\{ 0, 1 \\right\\} . 3.4.2 Does there exist a perfect set consisting of only rational numbers? Proof: No. This set must be countable, but a perfect set is uncountable. 3.4.3 Review the portion of the proof given in Example 3.4.2 and follow these steps to complete the argument. (a) Because x \u2208 C_1 , argue that there exists an x_1 \u2208 C \\cap C_1 with x_1 \\ne x satisfying |x \u2212 x_1| \u2264 1/3 . Proof: Let x_1 = 0, 1/3, 2/3, 1 . (b) Finish the proof by showing that for each n \u2208 N , there exists x_n \u2208 C \\cap C_n , different from x , satisfying |x \u2212 x_n| \u2264 1/3^n . Proof: pick either boundary. 3.4.4 Repeat the Cantor construction from Section 3.1 starting with the interval [0, 1] . This time, however, remove the open middle fourth from each component. (a) Is the resulting set compact? Perfect? Proof: It's compact. Since it's closed and bounded. It's also perfect we can follow the same argument as 3.4.3. 3.4.5 Let A and B be nonempty subsets of R. Show that if there exist disjoint open sets U and V with A\u2286U and B\u2286V ,then A and B are separated. Proof: Since V is open, V has no limit point of U , so \\overline{U} \\cap V = \\emptyset . Simiarly \\overline{V} \\cap U = \\emptyset . Then \\overline{A} \\cap B \\subseteq \\overline{V} \\cap U =\\emptyset and \\overline{B} \\cap A \\subseteq \\overline{U} \\cap V=\\emptyset . 3.4.6 Prove Theorem 3.4.6 Proof: * \\Rightarrow Assume E \u2286 R is connected and nonempty disjoint sets A and B satisfying E = A \u222a B . Assume there is no such sequence in both A and B . It means A has no limit points of B and B has no limit points of A . So A \\cap \\overline{B} = \\emptyset and B \\cap \\overline{A} = \\emptyset . Then E is not connected. * \\Leftarrow Assume for all nonempty disjoint sets A and B satisfying E = A \u222a B , there always exists a convergent sequence (x_n) \u2192 x with (x_n) contained in one of A or B , and x an element of the other. Then it means A \\cap \\overline{B} \\neq \\emptyset or B \\cap \\overline{A} \\neq \\emptyset . 3.4.7 A set E is totally disconnected if, given any two distinct points x,y \u2208 E , there exist separated sets A and B with x \u2208 A , y \u2208 B , and E = A\u222aB . (a) Show that Q is totally disconnected. Proof. Assume a, b \\in Q and a < b . Then we can find an irrational number r such that a < r < b , so let A = (-\\infty, r) \\cap Q and B = (r, \\infty) \\cap Q . (b) Is the set of irrational numbers totally disconnected? Proof. Yes. The same argument in (a) can also be applied here. See also stackoverflow . 3.4.8 Follow these steps to show that the Cantor set is totally disconnected in the sense described in Exercise 3.4.7. Let C = \\cap^\u221e_{n=0} C_n , as defined in Section 3.1. (a) Given x,y\u2208C ,with x<y , set \\epsilon = y\u2212x . For each n=0,1,2,..., the set C_n consists of a finite number of closed intervals. Explain why there must exist an N large enough so that it is impossible for x and y both to belong to the same closed interval of C_N . Proof. This is because the length of the internals C_n is 1/3^n . So we can find N large enough so 1/3^N < \\epsilon . (b) Show that C is totally disconnected. Proof. Since x,y\u2208C will not be in the same closed interval of C_N , and assume x < y , we can find z \\not\\in C_N such that x < z < y . Let A = (-\\infty, z) and B = (z, \\infty) . Using exercise 3.4.5, we know A \\cap C and B \\cap C are separated. So C is totally disconnected. 3.4.9 Let \\{r1, r2, r3, . . .\\} be an enumeration of the rational numbers, and for each n \\in N , set \\epsilon_n = 1/2^n . Define O = \\cup_{n=1}^\\infty V_{\\epsilon_n}(r_n) and let F = O^c . (a) Argue that F is a closed, nonempty set consisting only of irrational numbers. Proof: O is an union of open set, so it's open. Then F is closed. O contains all rational numbers, so F only contains irrational numbers. Now we need to prove F is not empty. Assume F is empty. Then consider [0, 1] and O is an open cover of it. Since it's compact, then we can find an finite sub cover of it. Then the total length of subcover is strictly less than 1 , then we must have some points not covered by this subcover. We got a contradiction. (b) Does F contain any nonempty open intervals? Is F totally disconnected? Proof. It's not possible. Because \\mathbb{Q} is dense. It's totally disconnected. (c) Is it possible to know whether F is perfect? If not, can we modify this construction to produce a nonempty perfect set of irrational numbers? Proof: I am inclined to think F is not perfect. But I cannot prove it for now. * I can prove F must have infinite elements for any given interval with length \\ge 2 . The way is pretty much the same as how we prove F is not empty. 3.5 Baire\u2019s Theorem 3.5.1 Argue that a set A is a G_\u03b4 set if and only if its complement is an F_\u03c3 set. Proof. Use De Morgan\u2019s Laws. 3.5.2 Replace each underscore with the word finite or countable, depending on which is more appropriate. (a) The finite/countable union of F_\u03c3 sets is an F_\u03c3 set. Both are correct. This is because countable union of countable sets is still countable union of sets. See also here . (b) The finite/countable intersection of F_\u03c3 sets is an F_\u03c3 set. Proof: First, countable intersection of F_\u03c3 sets might not be an F_\u03c3 set. Consider U_r = \\left\\{ x | x \\neq r \\right\\} where r is an rational number. Then U_r is F_\u03c3 set. But their intersection is I , which is all irrational numbers. As shown in Exercise 3.5.6, I cannot be F_\u03c3 set. Then finite intersection of F_\u03c3 sets might not be an F_\u03c3 set. Assume U = \\cup U_i and V = \\cup V_j . Then U \\cap V = \\cup U_i \\cap V_j . Since U_i \\cap V_j is closed. And there are countable of them, so U \\cap V is F_\u03c3 . (c) The finite/countable union of G_\u03b4 sets is a G_\u03b4 set. See (b) and De Morgan's law. (d) The finite/countable intersection of G_\u03b4 sets is a G_\u03b4 set. See (a) and De Morgan's law. 3.5.4 Prove Theorem 3.5.2. Proof: Since G_1 is open, we can find [a_1, b_1] \\subseteq G_1 . Since G_2 is dense, we can find [a_2, b_2] \\subseteq [a_1, b_1] and [a_2, b_2] \\subseteq G_2 . Then we construct a nested sequence of closed intervals I_1 \u2287 I_2 \u2287 I_3 \u2287\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 satisfying I_n \u2286 G_n . 3.5.5 Show that it is impossible to write R = \\cup_{n=1}^{\\infty} F_n where for each n \u2208 N , F_n is a closed set containing no nonempty open intervals. Proof: Consider G_n = (F_n)^c , so G_n is open, and it's also dense. Then from 3.5.4, the intersection of G_n is not empty. So the union of F_n cannot be the whole R . 3.5.6 Show how the previous exercise implies that the set I of irrationals cannot be an F_\u03c3 set, and Q cannot be a G_\u03b4 set. Proof: Assume I is an F_{\\sigma} set. I = \\cup_{n=1}^{\\infty} F_n F_n is a closed set containing no nonempty open intervals. And Q can be written as Q = \\cup_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\{q_n | q_n \\in Q\\} Q_n is a closed set containing no nonempty open intervals. And R = I \\cup Q . We have a contradiction. 3.5.7 Using Exercise 3.5.6 and versions of the statements in Exercise 3.5.2, construct a set that is neither in F_\u03c3 nor in G_\u03b4 . Solution: Let A = \\left\\{ x | x \\in [-1, 0] \\cap \\mathbf{I}\\right\\} and B = \\left\\{ x | x \\in [0, 1] \\cap \\mathbf{Q}\\right\\} . Let C = A \\cup B . Assume C is F_\u03c3 . We have C \\cap [-1, 0] = (A \\cup B) \\cap [-1, 0] = (A \\cap [-1, 0]) \\cup (B \\cap [-1, 0]) = A \\cup \\emptyset = A . So A is F_\u03c3 . But then \\mathbf{I} will be F_\u03c3 . We have a contradiction. Assume C is G_\u03b4 . C \\cap [0, 1] = (A \\cup B) \\cap [0, 1] = (A \\cap [0, 1]) \\cup (B \\cap [0, 1]) = \\emptyset \\cup B = B . We want to show B is not G_\u03b4 set. Assume otherwise. Consider B^c = (-\\infty, 0) \\cup ([0, 1] \\cap \\mathbf{I}) \\cup (1, \\infty) , which has to be F_\u03c3 . Then ([0, 1] \\cap \\mathbf{I}) has to be F_\u03c3 , which is impossible. So C is neither in F_\u03c3 nor in G_\u03b4 . 3.5.8 Show that a set E is nowhere-dense in \\mathbb{R} if and only if the complement of \\overline{E} is dense in R. Proof. \\Leftarrow Assume the complement of \\overline{E} is dense in \\mathbb{R} , also assume (a, b) \\subset \\overline{E} . Further assume a < c < b . Since (a, b) \\cap \\overline{E}^c = \\emptyset . c cannot be a limit point of \\overline{E}^c , so \\overline{\\overline{E}^c} \\ne \\mathbb{R} , so it's not dense, we have a contradiction. \\Rightarrow Conversely, assume E is nowhere-dense in \\mathbb{R} and a \\in \\overline{E} , because \\overline{E} does not contain open interval, in every V_{\\epsilon}(a) , we can find b \\in \\overline{E}^c , it means a is a limit point of \\overline{E}^c . So \\overline{\\overline{E}^c} = \\mathbb{R} . So the complement of \\overline{E} is dense in \\mathbb{R} . 3.5.9 Decide whether the following sets are dense in \\mathbb{R} , nowhere-dense in \\mathbb{R} , or somewhere in between. (a) A=Q\u2229[0,5] . Some where is between. Apparently, \\overline{A} = [0,5] which contains open interval. So it's not nowhere-dense. But it's not \\mathbb{R} , so it's not dense. But it's dense in [0,5] . (b) B =\\{1/n:n\u2208N\\} . nowhere-dense. (c) the set of irrationals. dense, since it's closure is \\mathbb{R} (d) the Cantor set. nowhere-dense. Since itself is a closed set. And it does not contain open interval. See exercise 3.4.8. 3.5.10 Finish the proof by finding a contradiction to the results in this section. Proof. We consider \\cup^{\u221e}_{n=1} \\overline{E_n} , then diretly apply Exercise 3.5.5. We can prove it.

Theorem 3.2.8 A set F \u2286 R is closed if and only if every Cauchy sequence contained in F has a limit that is also an element of F . Proof: See exercise 3.2.5.

Definition 3.3.1 (Compactness). A set K \\subseteq R is compact if every sequence in K has a subsequence that converges to a limit that is also in K . Example 3.3.2. The most basic example of a compact set is a closed interval. What are the properties of closed intervals that we used in the preceding argument? The Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass Theorem requires boundedness and we used the fact that closed sets contain their limit points. Definition 3.3.3. A set A \u2286 R is bounded if there exists M > 0 such that |a|\u2264M for all a\u2208A . Theorem 3.3.4 (Characterization of Compactness in R). A set K \\subseteq R is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. Proof: \\Rightarrow 3.4 Perfect Sets and Connected Sets One of the underlying goals of topology is to strip away all of the extraneous information that comes with our intuitive picture of the real numbers and isolate just those properties that are responsible for the phenomenon we are studying. Definition 3.4.1. A set P \u2286 \\mathbb{R} is perfect if it is closed and contains no isolated points. Example 3.4.2 (Cantor Set). It is not too hard to see that the Cantor set is perfect. See exercise 3.4.3. Theorem 3.4.3. A nonempty perfect set is uncountable. Summary of proof: Assume P is countable, and P = \\{x_1, x_2, \\dots\\} . Let I_1 be an interval such that x_1 in the interior of I_1 . Since x_1 is not isolated, we can find y_2 in the interior of I_1 . Then we can construct I_2 such that y_2 is in the middle of I_2 and I_2 \\subset I_1 and x_1 \\notin I_2 . We can continue this process and they satisfy: I_{n+1} \\subseteq I_n x_n \\notin I_{n+1} x_{n-1} \\neq y_n\\in I_n \\cap P \\neq \\emptyset . And let K_n = I_n \\cap P . Then based on Nested Compact Set Property, \\cap K_n is not empty. However, since x_n \\notin K_{n+1} , \\cap K_n = \\emptyset . We got a contradiction. Connected Sets Definition 3.4.4. Two nonempty sets A, B \u2286 R are separated if \\overline{A} \u2229 B and A \u2229 \\overline{B} are both empty. A set E \u2286 R is disconnected if it can be written as E = A \u222a B , where A and B are nonempty separated sets. A set that is not disconnected is called a connected set. Example 3.4.5. the set of rational numbers is disconnected. Just need to consider A = (-\\infty, \\sqrt{2}) and B = (\\sqrt{2}, \\infty) . Theorem 3.4.6. A set E \u2286 R is connected if and only if, for all nonempty disjoint sets A and B satisfying E = A \u222a B , there always exists a convergent sequence (x_n) \u2192 x with (x_n) contained in one of A or B , and x an element of the other. Proof: \\Rightarrow Assume E \u2286 R is connected and nonempty disjoint sets A and B satisfying E = A \u222a B . Assume there is no such sequence in both A and B . It means A has no limit points of B and B has no limit points of A . So A \\cap \\overline{B} = \\emptyset and B \\cap \\overline{A} = \\emptyset . Then E is not connected. \\Leftarrow Assume for all nonempty disjoint sets A and B satisfying E = A \u222a B , there always exists a convergent sequence (x_n) \u2192 x with (x_n) contained in one of A or B , and x an element of the other. Then it means A \\cap \\overline{B} \\neq \\emptyset or B \\cap \\overline{A} \\neq \\emptyset . Theorem 3.4.7. A set E \u2286 R is connected if and only if whenever a < c < b with a, b \u2208 E , it follows that c \u2208 E as well. Proof: \\Rightarrow : Assume E \\subseteq R is connected. Given a < c < b with a, b \u2208 E , and assume c \\notin E . Consider A = \\{a \\in E | a < c\\} , B = \\{b \\in E | b > c\\} . For any (x_n) \\in A , since x_n < c , then (x_n) \\rightarrow x \\le c . So x \\notin B . Similarly, if (x_n) \\rightarrow x \\in B ,then x \\notin A . Then from Theorem 3.4.6, E is not connected. We have a contradiction. \\Leftarrow : Conversely assume a < c < b with a, b \u2208 E , it follows that c \u2208 E . Assume E = A \\cup B, a \\in A, b \\in B, a < b . Let A' = A \\cap (-\\infty, b), c = \\sup A' . So we have a \\le c \\le b, c \\in E . If c \\in B , then \\overline{A} \\cap B \\ne \\emptyset . If c \\in A , then c \\neq b , then (c, b] \\subseteq E . So c is a limit point of (c, b] , thus a limit point of B . So \\overline{B} \\cap A \\ne \\emptyset . Textbook method to prove \\Leftarrow (more elegant): assume a < c < b with a, b \u2208 E , it follows that c \u2208 E . Assume E = A \\cup B, a_0 \\in A, b_0 \\in B, a_0 < b_0, I_0 = [a_0, b_0] . Let c = (a_0 + b_0)/2 : if c \\in A , then a_1 = c, b_1 = b_0 . if c \\in B , then a_1 = a_0, b_1 = c, I_1 = [a_1, b_1] . Then we have I_0 \\supset I_1 \\supset \\cdots . From Nested Interval Property, we have \\lim a_n = \\lim b_n = x \\in \\cap I_n . 3.5 Baire\u2019s Theorem Definition 3.5.1. A set A \u2286 R is called an F_\u03c3 set if it can be written as the countable union of closed sets. A set B \u2286 R is called a G_\u03b4 set if it can be written as the countable intersection of open sets. Exercise 3.5.1. Argue that a set A is a G_\u03b4 set if and only if its complement is an F_\u03c3 set. Proof. Use De Morgan\u2019s Laws. Exercise 3.5.2. Replace each underscore with the word finite or countable, depending on which is more appropriate. (a) The finite/countable union of F_\u03c3 sets is an F_\u03c3 set. Both are correct. This is because countable union of countable sets is still countable union of sets. See also here . (b) The finite/countable intersection of F_\u03c3 sets is an F_\u03c3 set. Proof: First, countable intersection of F_\u03c3 sets might not be an F_\u03c3 set. Consider U_r = \\left\\{ x | x \\neq r \\right\\} where r is an rational number. Then U_r is F_\u03c3 set. But their intersection is I , which is all irrational numbers. As shown in Exercise 3.5.6, I cannot be F_\u03c3 set. Then finite intersection of F_\u03c3 sets might not be an F_\u03c3 set. Assume U = \\cup U_i and V = \\cup V_j . Then U \\cap V = \\cup U_i \\cap V_j . Since U_i \\cap V_j is closed. And there are countable of them, so U \\cap V is F_\u03c3 . (c) The finite/countable union of G_\u03b4 sets is a G_\u03b4 set. See (b) and De Morgan's law. (d) The finite/countable intersection of G_\u03b4 sets is a G_\u03b4 set. See (a) and De Morgan's law. Recall that a set G \u2286 \\mathbb{R} is dense in \\mathbb{R} if, given any two real numbers a<b , it is possible to find a point x \u2208 G with a<x<b . Theorem 3.5.2. If {G_1, G_2, G_3,...} is a countable collection of dense, open sets, then the intersection \\cap_{n=1}^\\infty G_n is not empty. Exercise 3.5.4. Prove Theorem 3.5.2. Proof: Since G_1 is open, we can find [a_1, b_1] \\subseteq G_1 . Since G_2 is dense, we can find [a_2, b_2] \\subseteq [a_1, b_1] and [a_2, b_2] \\subseteq G_2 . Then we construct a nested sequence of closed intervals I_1 \u2287 I_2 \u2287 I_3 \u2287\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 satisfying I_n \u2286 G_n . Exercise 3.5.5. Show that it is impossible to write R = \\cup_{n=1}^{\\infty} F_n where for each n \u2208 N , F_n is a closed set containing no nonempty open intervals. Proof: Consider G_n = (F_n)^c , so G_n is open, and it's also dense. Then from 3.5.4, the intersection of G_n is not empty. So the union of F_n cannot be the whole R . Exercise 3.5.6. Show how the previous exercise implies that the set I of irrationals cannot be an F_\u03c3 set, and Q cannot be a G_\u03b4 set. Proof: Assume I is an F_{\\sigma} set. I = \\cup_{n=1}^{\\infty} F_n F_n is a closed set containing no nonempty open intervals. And Q can be written as Q = \\cup_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\{q_n | q_n \\in Q\\} Q_n is a closed set containing no nonempty open intervals. And R = I \\cup Q . We have a contradiction. Exercise 3.5.7. Using Exercise 3.5.6 and versions of the statements in Exercise 3.5.2, construct a set that is neither in F_\u03c3 nor in G_\u03b4 . Solution: Let A = \\left\\{ x | x \\in [-1, 0] \\cap \\mathbf{I}\\right\\} and B = \\left\\{ x | x \\in [0, 1] \\cap \\mathbf{Q}\\right\\} . Let C = A \\cup B . Assume C is F_\u03c3 . We have C \\cap [-1, 0] = (A \\cup B) \\cap [-1, 0] = (A \\cap [-1, 0]) \\cup (B \\cap [-1, 0]) = A \\cup \\emptyset = A . So A is F_\u03c3 . But then \\mathbf{I} will be F_\u03c3 . We have a contradiction. Assume C is G_\u03b4 . C \\cap [0, 1] = (A \\cup B) \\cap [0, 1] = (A \\cap [0, 1]) \\cup (B \\cap [0, 1]) = \\emptyset \\cup B = B . We want to show B is not G_\u03b4 set. Assume otherwise. Consider B^c = (-\\infty, 0) \\cup ([0, 1] \\cap \\mathbf{I}) \\cup (1, \\infty) , which has to be F_\u03c3 .

Replace each underscore with the word finite or countable, depending on which is more appropriate. (a) The finite/countable union of F_\u03c3 sets is an F_\u03c3 set. Both are correct. This is because countable union of countable sets is still countable union of sets. See also here . (b) The finite/countable intersection of F_\u03c3 sets is an F_\u03c3 set. Proof: First, countable intersection of F_\u03c3 sets might not be an F_\u03c3 set. Consider U_r = \\left\\{ x | x \\neq r \\right\\} where r is an rational number. Then U_r is F_\u03c3 set.

Based on exercise 4.2.7, it's 0. 4.2.9 (Infinite Limits) Definition: \\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = \\infty means that for all M > 0 we can find a \u03b4 > 0 such that whenever 0 < |x \u2212 c| < \u03b4 , it follows that f(x) > M . (a) Show \\lim_{x \\to 0} 1/x^2 = \\infty in the sense described in the previous definition. Proof: Given M > 0 , let \\delta = 1/\\sqrt{M} , then when 0 < |x| < 1/\\sqrt{M} , 1/x^2 > M . (b) Now, construct a definition for the statement \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = L . Show \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} 1/x = 0 . Solution: for all \\epsilon > 0 , we can find a N such that whenever x > N , f(x) \\in V_{\\epsilon}(L) . To prove \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} 1/x = 0 , given \\epsilon > 0 , let N = 1/\\epsilon . (c) What would a rigorous definition for \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = \\infty look like? Give an example of such a limit. Solution: It means that for all M > 0 we can find a N > 0 such that whenever x > N , it follows that f(x) > M . One example is f(x) = x . 4.2.10 (Right and Left Limits) (a) Give a proper definition in the style of Definition 4.2.1 for the right-hand and left-hand limit statements: \\lim_{x \\to a^+} f(x) = L \\text{ and} \\lim_{x \\to a^-} f(x) = L Solution: \\lim_{x \\to a^+} f(x) = L means for all \\epsilon > 0 , we can find \\delta , such that whenever 0 < x - a < \\delta , |f(x) - L| < \\epsilon . (b) Prove that \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = L if and only if both the right and left-hand limits equal L . Proof: \\Rightarrow if \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = L , then for any \\epsilon > 0 , we can find \\delta , such that whenever |x-a| < \\delta , |f(x)- L| < \\epsilon . Then, we find \\delta such that whenever 0 < x - a < \\delta , |f(x) - L| < \\epsilon . So \\lim_{x \\to a^+} f(x) = L . \\Leftarrow if \\lim_{x \\to a^+} f(x) = L and \\lim_{x \\to a^-} f(x) = L . Then given \\epsilon > 0 , we can find \\delta^+, \\delta^- such that as long as 0 < x - a < \\delta^+ or 0 < a - x < \\delta^- , |f(x) - L| < \\epsilon . Let \\delta = \\min \\left\\{ \\delta^+, \\delta^- \\right\\} . 4.2.11 (Squeeze Theorem). Let f, g, h satisfy f(x) \\leq g(x) \\leq h(x) for all x in some common domain A . if \\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = L and \\lim_{x \\to c} h(x) = L at some limit point c of A , show \\lim_{x \\to c} g(x) = L . Proof: Given any sequence (x_n) \\rightarrow c , f(x_n) \\leq g(x_n) \\leq h(x_n) , so \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} g(x_n) = L . According to Theorem 4.2.3, \\lim_{x \\to c} g(x) = L . 4.3 Continuous Functions 4.3.3 (a) Supply a proof for Theorem 4.3.9 using the \\epsilon\u2013\u03b4 characterization of continuity. Proof: Let d = f(c) . Since g is continuous at d , then given any \\epsilon > 0 , we can find V_{\\delta }(d) , as long as x \\in V_{\\delta }(d) , g(x) \\in V_{\\epsilon }(g(d)) . And since f is continuous at c , then we can find \\zeta > 0 , as long as x \\in V_{\\zeta }(c) , f(x) \\in V_{\\delta }(d) . And in turn, g(f(x)) \\in V_{\\epsilon}(g(f(c)) . So g \\circ f is continuous at c . 4.3.4 Assume f and g are defined on all of \\mathbf{R} and that \\lim_{x \\to p} f(x) = q and \\lim_{x \\to q} g(x) = r . (a) Give an example to show that it may not be true that \\lim_{x \\to p} g(f(x)) = r. Let f be the Modified Dirichlet Function, i.e. f(x) = \\begin{cases} x &\\text{if } x \\in \\mathbf{Q} \\\\ 0 &\\text{if } x \\not\\in \\mathbf{Q} \\\\ \\end{cases} Let g(x) be g(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 &\\text{if } x = 0 \\\\ 0 &\\text{if } x \\neq 0 \\\\ \\end{cases} Assume (x_n) \\rightarrow 0 and x_n are all irrational numbers. Then g(f(x_n)) \\rightarrow 1 . On the other hand, (y_n) \\rightarrow 0 and y_n are all rational numbers, so g(f(y_n)) \\rightarrow 0 . \\lim_{x \\to p} g(f(x)) does not exist at all. (b) Show that the result in (a) does follow if we assume f and g are continuous. Proof: This is Theorem 4.3.9. (c) Does the result in (a) hold if we only assume f is continuous? How about if we only assume that g is continuous? Proof: if only f is continuous, then (a) might not hold. Let f(x) = x \\sin \\frac{1}{x} \\\\ g(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 &\\text{if } x = 0 \\\\ 0 &\\text{if } x \\neq 0 \\\\ \\end{cases} Then f(x) is continuous. Consider (x_n) = \\frac{1}{(2n \\pi )} , then (x_n) \\rightarrow 0 , and \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} g(f(x_n)) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} 1 = 1 . Now consider (y_n) = \\frac{1}{(2n + 1/2) \\pi} , then (y_n) \\rightarrow 0 , and \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} g(f(y_n)) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} 0 = 0 . So \\lim_{x \\to 0} g(f(x)) = 0 does not exist. Now if only g is continuous. Let \\lim_{x \\to q} g(x) = r = g(q) . Then if x \\in V_{\\delta}(q) , then g(x) \\in V_{\\epsilon}(r) . Since \\lim_{x \\to p} f(x) = q , then we can find \\sigma , such that x \\in V_{\\sigma}(p) , f(x) \\in V_{\\delta}(q) . 4.3.5 Show using Definition 4.3.1 that if c is an isolated point of A \u2286 \\mathbf{R} , then f : A \u2192 \\mathbf{R} is continuous at c . Proof: Since c is an isolated point of A , there is a \\delta , such that V_{\\delta_0}(c) \\cap A = \\left\\{ c \\right\\} . Given any \\epsilon > 0 , as long as |x - c| < \\delta_0 , |f(x) - f(c)| = |f(c) - f(c)| = 0 < \\epsilon \\square . 4.3.6 Provide an example of each or explain why the request is impossible. (a) Two functions f and g , neither of which is continuous at 0 but such that f(x)g(x) and f(x) + g(x) are continuous at 0 . Solution: Consider f(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 &\\text{if } x = 0 \\\\ 0 &\\text{if } x \\neq 0 \\\\ \\end{cases} \\\\ and g(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 &\\text{if } x \\neq 0 \\\\ 0 &\\text{if } x = 0 \\\\ \\end{cases} \\\\ Then f(x)g(x) = 0 and f(x) + g(x) = 1 are continuous everywhere. (b) A function f(x) continuous at 0 and g(x) not continuous at 0 such that f(x) + g(x) is continuous at 0 . Solution: it's not possible. Let h(x) = f(x) + g(x) . If h(x), f(x) are continuous. Then h(x) - f(x) will be continuous. (c) A function f(x) continuous at 0 and g(x) not continuous at 0 such that f(x)g(x) is continuous at 0 . Solution: Let f(x) = 0 , and g(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 &\\text{if } x \\neq 0 \\\\ 0 &\\text{if } x = 0 \\\\ \\end{cases} \\\\ \\square (d) A function f(x) not continuous at 0 such that f(x) + \\frac{1}{f(x)} is continuous at 0 . f(x) = \\begin{cases} x + 2 &\\text{if } x \\neq 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{2} &\\text{if } x = 0 \\\\ \\end{cases} \\square (e) A function f(x) not continuous at 0 such that [f(x)]^3 is continuous at 0 . Solution: this is not possible. If f(0) = 0 , then since f^3(x) is continuous, we can find \\delta such that |f^3(x)| < \\epsilon^3 , then |f(x)| < \\epsilon . If f(0) = c \\neq 0 , then |f(x) - f(0)| = |\\frac{f^3(x) - f^3(0)}{f^2(x) + f(x)f(0) + f^2(0)}| \\\\ = |\\frac{f^3(x) - f^3(0)}{(f(x) + f(0)/2)^2+3/4f^2(0)}| \\\\ \\leq |\\frac{f^3(x) - f^3(0)}{3/4f^2(0)}| So |f(x) - f(0)| < \\epsilon . 4.3.7 (a) Referring to the proper theorems, give a formal argument that Dirichlet\u2019s function from Section 4.1 is nowhere-continuous on R. Proof: g(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 &\\text{if } x \\in \\mathbf{Q}\\\\ 0 &\\text{if } x \\not\\in \\mathbf{Q}\\\\ \\end{cases} Given any x , one sequence (a_n) \\rightarrow x , where they are all rational numbers. Given (b_n) \\rightarrow x , where they are all irrational numbers. According to Corollary 4.3.3, Dirichlet\u2019s function from is nowhere-continuous on \\mathbf{R} . \\square (b) Review the definition of Thomae\u2019s function in Section 4.1 and demonstrate that it fails to be continuous at every rational point. Proof: Given (b_n) \\rightarrow x , where they are all irrational numbers. (c) Use the characterization of continuity in Theorem 4.3.2 (iii) to show that Thomae\u2019s function is continuous at every irrational point in \\mathbf{R} . (Given \u03b5 > 0 , consider the set of points \\{x \u2208 R : t(x) \u2265 \u03b5\\} .) Proof: For any irrational point, and any natural number n , we can find integer m , such that m/n < x < (m+1)/n . Let \\epsilon < 1/N , and find \\delta such that none of the 2N points are in the V_{\\delta}(x) . \\square 4.3.8 Decide if the following claims are true or false, providing either a short proof or counterexample to justify each conclusion. Assume throughout that g is defined and continuous on all of \\mathbf{R} . (a) If g(x)\u22650 for all x<1 ,then g(1)\u22650 as well. Proof: True. Given (x_n) \\rightarrow 1 . Since g(x_n) \\geq 0 , then g(1) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} g(x_n) \\geq 0 . \\square . (b) If g(r)=0 for all r\u2208 \\mathbf{Q} ,then g(x)=0 for all x\u2208R . Proof: True. Given (x_n) \\rightarrow a , where a is an irrational number. g(a) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} g(x_n) = 0 . 4.3.10 Observe that if a and b are real numbers, then \\max \\left\\{ a, b \\right\\} = \\frac{1}{2} [(a+b)+|a-b|]. show that if f_1, f_2, \\dots, f_n are continuous functions, then g(x) = \\max \\left\\{ f_1(x), f_2(x), \\dots f_n(x) \\right\\} is a continuous function. Proof: If f(x) is a continuous function and given c , and \\epsilon > 0 , we can find \\delta > 0 , if x \\in V_{\\delta }(c) , then |f(x) - f(c)| < \\epsilon . Since ||f(x)| - |f(c)|| \\le |f(x) - f(c)| < \\epsilon , so |f(x)| is also continuous function. Then g(x) = \\max \\left\\{ f_1(x), f_2(x) \\right\\}= \\frac{1}{2} [(f_1(x) + f_2(x)) + |f_1(x) - f_2(x)|] is also continuous. Then we can use induction to see it's true for any n . another approach For c , assume g(c) = \\max \\left\\{ f_1(c), f_2(c), \\dots f_n(c) \\right\\} = f_1(c) . Assume (x_n) \\rightarrow c , and assume (x_{n_k}) is a subsequence and g(x_{n_k}) = f_2(x_{n_k}) . Since f_2 is continuous, we have (f_2(x_{n_k})) \\rightarrow f_2(c) . Since \\max \\left\\{ f_1(c), f_2(c), \\dots f_n(c) \\right\\} = f_1(c) , we have f_1(c) \\geq f_2(c) . Since f_1(x_{n_k}) \\leq f_2(x_{n_k}) and (f_1(x_{n_k})) \\rightarrow f_1(c) , we have f_1(c) \\leq f_2(c) . So f_1(c) = f_2(c) . This means g(x_n) \\rightarrow g(c) . So g(x) is continuous. Let\u2019s explore whether the result in (a) extends to the infinite case. For each n \u2208 \\mathbf{N} , define f_n on \\mathbf{R} by f_n(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 &\\text{if } |x| \\geq 1/n \\\\ n|x| &\\text{if } |x| < 1/n \\\\ \\end{cases} Now explicitly compute h(x) = \\sup \\left\\{f_1(x), f_2(x), f_3(x), \\dots\\right\\} . Solution: h(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 &\\text{if } x \\neq 0 \\\\ 0 &\\text{if } x = 0 \\\\ \\end{cases} So h(x) is not continuous at 0 . 4.3.11 (Contraction Mapping Theorem). Let f be a function defined on all of \\mathbf{R} , and assume there is a constant c such that 0 <c< 1 and \\left| f(x) - f(y) \\right| \\leq c|x-y| for all x, y \\in \\mathbf{R} . i. Show that f(x) is continuous on \\mathbf{R} . Proof: Given \\epsilon , let \\delta = \\epsilon / c . Then \\left| f(x) - f(y) \\right| \\leq c|x-y| < c (\\epsilon / c) = \\epsilon . ii. Pick some point y_1 \u2208 \\mathbf{R} and construct the sequence (y_1, f(y_1), f(f(y_1)), \\dots) In general, if y_{n+1} = f(y_n) , show that the resulting sequence (y_n) is a Cauchy sequence. Hence we may let y = \\lim y_n . Proof: First, we prove (y_n) is bounded. Assume |y_2 - y_1| = M , then |y_2| \\leq \\left| y_1 \\right| + M . \\left| y_3 - y_2 \\right| \\leq c |y_2 - y_1| = cM \\\\ |y_3| \\leq |y_2| + cM \\leq |y_1| + (1 + c)M \\\\ |y_n| \\leq |y_1| + \\frac{1}{1 - c}M = K So assume n > m , |y_n - y_m| = c^{m-1} | y_{n-m+1} - y_1| \\leq c^{m-1} 2K So (y_n) is Cauchy sequence. iii. Prove that y is a fixed point of f (i.e., f(y) = y ) and that it is unique in this regard. Proof: Assume f(y) \\neq y . Since (y_n) \\rightarrow y , we can find y_1 and y_2 = f(y_1) , which are close enough to y . And |y_1 - y| < \\epsilon , |y_2 - y| < \\epsilon but |y_2 - f(y)| > \\epsilon . Then \\epsilon < |y_2 - f(y)| = |f(y_1)-f(y)| \\leq c|y_1-y| < |y_1 - y| < \\epsilon , we have a contradiction. iv. Finally, prove that if x is any arbitrary point in , then the sequence (x, f(x), f(f(x)),...) converges to y defined in (2). Proof: Assume (x_n) \\rightarrow x and (y_n) \\rightarrow y , then |x - y| \\le |x - x_n | + |x_n - y_n | + | y_n - y | < \\epsilon + c^n|x - y| + \\epsilon and can be arbitrarily small. So x = y . 4.3.12 Let F \u2286 R be a nonempty closed set and define g(x) = \\inf\\{|x \u2212 a| : a \u2208 F\\} . Show that g is continuous on all of \\mathbf{R} and g(x) \\neq 0 for all x \\not\\in F . Proof: If c \\in F , then g(c) = 0 , |g(x) - g(c)| = |g(x)| \\leq |x - c| . So g is continuous at c . If c \\not\\in F , then we can find x_1, x_2 \\in F such that c \\in (x1, x2) \\cap F = \\emptyset . So g(c) = \\min \\left\\{ c - x1, x2 - c \\right\\} \\neq 0 . Choose \\delta < \\min \\left\\{ c - x_1, x_2 - c \\right\\} , then |g(x) - g(c)| \\leq |x - c| , so g(x) is also continuous at c \\not\\in F . 4.3.13 Let f be a function defined on all of \\mathbf{R} that satisfies the additive condition f (x + y) = f (x) + f (y) for all x, y \u2208 \\mathbf{R} . (a) Show that f(0)=0 and that f(\u2212x)=\u2212f(x) for all x\u2208\\mathbf{R} . Proof: f(0) = f(0+0) = f(0) + f(0) , so f(0) = 0 . f(x) + f(-x) = f(x-x) = f(0) = 0 , so f(-x) = -f(x) . (b) Let k=f(1) . Show that f(n)=kn for all n\u2208N ,and then prove that f(z) = kz for all z \u2208 Z . Now, prove that f(r) = kr for any rational number r . Proof: let r = p/q . f(1) = f(1/q + \\dots+1/q) = qf(1/q) , so f(q) = f(1)/q . So f(r) = kr . (c) Show that if f is continuous at x = 0 , then f is continuous at every point in \\mathbf{R} and conclude that f(x) = kx for all x \u2208 R . Proof: |f(x) - f(y)| = |f(x-y)| , since f(0) is continuous at 0, then |f(x-y)| < \\epsilon . So f is continuous at every point in \\mathbf{R} . We can find a rational sequence converges to x , so f(x) = kx . 4.3.14 (a) Let F be a closed set. Construct a function f : \\mathbf{R} \\mapsto \\mathbf{R} , such that the set of points where f fails to be continuous is precisely F . (The concept of the interior of a set, discussed in Exercise 3.2.14, may be useful.) Solution: consider f(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 &\\text{if } x \\not\\in F\\\\ 1 &\\text{if } x \\in F \\cap \\mathbf{Q}\\\\ -1 &\\text{if } x \\in F \\cap \\overline{\\mathbf{Q}}\\\\ \\end{cases} If x \\in E^o , then we can find (x-\\epsilon , x+\\epsilon) \\subset F , since both \\mathbf{Q} and (b) Now consider an open set O . Construct a function g : R \u2192 R whose set of discontinuous points is precisely O . (For this problem, the function in Exercise 4.3.12 may be useful.) Solution: consider F = \\mathbf{R} - O and g(x) is in Exercise 4.3.12. f(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 &\\text{if } x \\in O \\cap I \\\\ g(x) &\\text{otherwise} \\\\ \\end{cases} First, f(x) is continuous at c \\in F . It can be proved the same way in 4.3.12. Next if x \\in O is rational, then g(x) > 0 . But we can find a sequence of irrational numbers (x_n) \\rightarrow x and f(x_n) = 0 . So \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f(x_n) = 0 \\neq f(x) . Finally if x \\in O is irrational, and assume x_1 < y_1 < x < y_2 < x_2 where x_1, x_2 \\in F , y_1, y_2 \\in O \\cap \\mathbf{Q} . Given any y_1 < y < y_2 \\in \\mathbf{Q} , g(y) > \\min \\left\\{ y_1-x_1, x_2-y_2\\right\\} > 0 . Since f(x) = 0 , then f(x) is not continuous at x . 4.4 Continuous Functions on Compact Sets 4.4.4 Decide whether each of the following statements is true or false, justifying each conclusion. (a) If f is continuous on [a,b] with f(x) > 0 for all a \u2264 x \u2264 b , then 1/f is bounded on [a, b] (meaning 1/f has bounded range). Solution: True. Since f is continuous on [a,b] . then f(x) attains maximum and minimum value, say c and d which are all > 0 . Then 1/f is bounded by [1/c, 1/d] . (b) If f is uniformly continuous on a bounded set A , then f(A) is bounded. Solution: True. Assume otherwise, we can find a sequence (x_n) such that \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f(x_n) = \\infty . Since A is bounded, we can assume (x_n) \\rightarrow x . Given \\epsilon_0 and any \\delta , we can find \\delta' < \\delta/2 , such that x_1, x_2 \\in V_{\\delta /2}(x) and |f(x_1) - f(x_2)| > \\epsilon . So f is not uniformly continuous. We have a contradiction. (c) If f is defined on \\mathbf{R} and f(K) is compact whenever K is compact, then f is continuous on \\mathbf{R} . Solution: False. Consdier Dirichlet function. f(K) = \\{0, 1\\} is always compact. 4.4.6 Give an example of each of the following, or state that such a request is impossible. For any that are impossible, supply a short explanation for why this is the case. (a) A continuous function f : (0,1) \u2192 R and a Cauchy sequence (x_n) such that f(x_n) is not a Cauchy sequence. Solution: Consdier f(x) = 1/x and x_n = 1/n . (b) A uniformly continuous function f : (0, 1) \u2192 R and a Cauchy sequence (x_n) such that f(x_n) is not a Cauchy sequence; Solution: This is impossible. Given \\epsilon , we can find \\delta , such that |x_n - x_m| < \\delta , |f(x_n) - f(x_m)| < \\epsilon . We can also find N , as long as n, m > N then |x_n - x_m| < \\delta \u3002 Then we have |f(x_n) - f(x_m)| < \\epsilon . (c) A continuous function f : [0,\u221e) \u2192 \\mathbf{R} and a Cauchy sequence (x_n) such that f (x_n) is not a Cauchy sequence. Solution: This is impossible. Since (x_n) is Cauchy sequence, then it's bounded. Assume x_n \\in [0, M] , then f is uniformly continuous. So f (x_n) must be Cauchy. 4.4.7. Prove that f (x) = \\sqrt[]{x} is uniformly continuous on [0, \u221e) . Proof: If x_1, x_2 \\geq 1 , then |\\sqrt[]{x_1} - \\sqrt[]{x_2}| = |(x_1 - x_2)/(\\sqrt[]{x_1} + \\sqrt[]{x_2})| \\leq |(x_1 - x_2)/2| So f(x) is uniformly continuous on [1, \\infty ] . It's also uniformly continuous on [0,1] since [0,1] is a closed set. Similar to Exercise 4.4.5, f(x) is uniformly continuous on [0, \u221e) . 4.4.8 Give an example of each of the following, or provide a short argument for why the request is impossible. (a) A continuous function defined on [0, 1] with range (0, 1) . Solution: this is impossible. According to Theorem 4.4.1, f(K) must be compact. But (0,1) is not. (b) A continuous function defined on (0, 1) with range [0, 1] . Solution: Consider f(x) = |\\sin 2 \\pi x| (c) A continuous function defined on (0, 1] with range (0, 1) . Solution: Consdier f(x) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{(1-x)}{2} \\sin \\frac{1}{x} 4.4.9 (Lipschitz Functions). A function f : A \u2192 R is called Lipschitz if there exists a bound M > 0 such that |\\frac{f(x) - f(y)}{x - y}| \\leq M for all x \\neq y \u2208 A . Geometrically speaking, a function f is Lipschitz if there is a uniform bound on the magnitude of the slopes of lines drawn through any two points on the graph of f . (a) Show that if f : A \u2192 \\mathbf{R} is Lipschitz, then it is uniformly continuous on A . Proof: Given \\epsilon , we can find \\delta = \\epsilon / M . (b) Is the converse statement true? Are all uniformly continuous functions necessarily Lipschitz? Solution: False. Consider f(x) = x^2 : \\mathbf{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R} . It's uniformly continuous. But it's not Lipschitz. 4.4.10 Assume that f and g are uniformly continuous functions defined on a common domain A . Which of the following combinations are necessarily uniformly continuous on A : (a) f(x) + g(x) Solution: yes. (b) f(x)g(x) Solution: No. Consider f(x) = g(x) = x . (c) f(x)/g(x) Solution: No. Consider f(x) = x, g(x) = 1/x, A = [1, \\infty ] . (d) f(g(x)) Solution: Yes. Given \\epsilon , since f is uniformly continuous, we can find \\zeta , as long as |y_1 - y_2| < \\zeta , |f(y_1) - f(y_2)| < \\epsilon . Since g is also uniformly continuous, we can find \\delta , as long as |x_1 - x_2| < \\delta , |g(x_1) - g(x_2)| < \\zeta , so |f(g(x_1)) - f(g(x_2))| < \\epsilon . 4.4.11 (Topological Characterization of Continuity) Let g be defined on all of \\mathbf{R} . If B is a subset of \\mathbf{R} , define the set g^{\u22121}(B) by g^{\u22121}(B)= \\left\\{ x \\in \\mathbf{R} : g(x) \\in B \\right\\} Show that g is continuous if and only if g^{\u22121}(O) is open whenever O \u2286 \\mathbf{R} is an open set. Proof: \\Rightarrow Assume g is continuous, and O \\subseteq \\mathbf{R} is open. x \\in g^{\u22121}(O) , so y = f(x) \\in O . Since O is open, we can find V_{\\epsilon}(y) \\subseteq O . Since g is continuous, we can find U_{\\delta}(x) such that f(U) \\subseteq O , so U \\subseteq g^{\u22121}(O) . Which means g^{\u22121}(O) is open. \\Leftarrow : Assume f(x) = y , then V_{\\epsilon}(y) is open, so x \\in g^{-1}(V_{\\epsilon}(y)) is open. Then we can fine V_{\\delta }(x) \\subset g^{-1}(V_{\\epsilon}(y)) , so f(V_{\\delta }(x)) \\subseteq V_{\\epsilon}(y) . So g is continuous. 4.4.12. Review Exercise 4.4.11, and then determine which of the following statements is true about a continuous function defined on R: (a) f^{-1}(B) is finite whenever B is finite. Solution: False. Consider a constant function: f(x) = 0 . (b) f^{\u22121}(K) is compact whenever K is compact. Solution: False. Consider f(x) = \\sin x . When K = [-1, 1] , then f^{\u22121}(K) = \\mathbf{R} which is not compact. (c) f^{\u22121}(A) is bounded whenever A is bounded. Solution: Same example from (b). (d) f^{\u22121}(F) is closed whenever F is closed. Solution: False. Consider f(x) = \\ln x , and F = \\mathbf{R} . Then f^{\u22121}(F) = (0, +\\infty) which is open. 4.4.13 (Continuous Extension Theorem) (a) Show that a uniformly continuous function preserves Cauchy sequences; that is, if f : A \u2192 R is uniformly continuous and (x_n) \u2286 A is a Cauchy sequence, then show f(x_n) is a Cauchy sequence. 4.5 The Intermediate Value Theorem 4.5.1 Show how the Intermediate Value Theorem follows as a corol- lary to Theorem 4.5.2. Proof: Let C = f([a, b]) , since [a, b] is connected and f is continuous, then according to Theorem 4.5.2 C is connected also. Since f(a), f(b) \\in C , then [f(a), f(b)] \\subseteq C , then L \\in C . Then there exists a point c \u2208 (a,b) where f(c) = L . \\square 4.5.2 Provide an example of each of the following, or explain why the request is impossible. (a) A continuous function defined on an open interval with range equal to a closed interval. Solution: Consider \\sin x defined on (-100 \\pi , +100 \\pi ) . The range of it is [-1, +1] (b) A continuous function defined on a closed interval with range equal to an open interval. Solution: If the closed interval is bounded, then it's compact. Then the range has to be compact, which is closed and bounded. So it's impossible for the range to be open. On the other hand, if the closed interval is unbounded, e.g. [0, +\\infty) , then consider x \\sin x . Then range is \\mathbf{R} , which is open. (c) A continuous function defined on an open interval with range equal to an unbounded closed set different from \\mathbf{R} . Solution: Consider f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} defined on (-1, 1) . The range is (-\\infty, -1] . (d) A continuous function defined on all of \\mathbf{R} with range equal to \\mathbf{Q} . Solution: this is impossible. According to theorem 4.5.2, f(\\mathbf{R}) is connected. But \\mathbf{Q} is not connected. 4.5.3 A function f is increasing on A if f(x) \u2264 f(y) for all x < y in A . Show that if f is increasing on [a, b] and satisfies the intermediate value property (Definition 4.5.3), then f is continuous on [a, b] . Proof: Let c \\in (a, b) and any \\epsilon such that f(a) \\leq f(c) - \\epsilon < f(c) \\leq f(c) + \\epsilon \\leq f(b) . Since f(x) satisfies intermediate value property, we can find c_0, c_1 such that f(c_0) = f(c) - \\epsilon and f(c_1) = f(c) + \\epsilon . Since f is increasing, we have c_0 < c < c_1 . Let \\delta = \\min \\left\\{ c - c_0, c_1 - c \\right\\} . If x \\in V_{\\delta}(c) , x \\in (c_0, c_1) and f(x) \\in (f(c_0), f(c_1)) . So \\left| f(c) - f(x) \\right| < \\epsilon . \\square 4.5.4 Let g be continuous on an interval A and let F be the set of points where g fails to be one-to-one; that is, F = \\left\\{ x \\in A: f(x) = f(y) \\text{ for some } y \\neq x \\text{ and } y \\in A \\right\\} Show F is either empty or uncountable. Proof: If F is not empty, then let a, b \\in F and a < b . If f(x) is the same for all x \\in [a, b] , then F \\supseteq [a, b] , which is uncountable. If c \\in [a, b] and f(c) \\neq f(a) . Assume f(c) > f(a) , then using (IVF), for every k \\in (f(a), f(c)) we can find d \\in (a, c) and e \\in (c, b) , such that f(d) = f(e) = k . Since (f(a), f(c)) is uncountable, then F is uncountable. \\square . 4.5.5 (a) Finish the proof of the Intermediate Value Theorem using the Axiom of Completeness started previously. Proof: continue with where we left. We first show f(c) \\not > 0 . If f(c) = a > 0 , then since f(x) is continuous, there is a V_{\\epsilon}(c) , such that as long as x \\in V_{\\epsilon}(c) , f(x) > 0 . Then c is not \\sup K . So f(c) \\not > 0 . Next we show f(c) \\not < 0 . The same argument above can be applied to this scenario. So f(c) = 0 . \\square (b) Finish the proof of the Intermediate Value Theorem using the Nested Interval Property started previously. Proof: (a_n) \\rightarrow c . Since f is continuous, f(a_n) \\rightarrow f(c) . Since f(a_n) < 0 , then f(c) \\leq 0 . For the same reason, f(c) \\geq 0 . So f(c) = 0 . \\square 4.5.6 Let f : [0, 1] \u2192 \\mathbf{R} be continuous with f(0) = f (1) . (a) Show that there must exist x, y \u2208 [0, 1] satisfying |x \u2212 y| = 1/2 and f(x) = f(y) . Proof: define g(x) = f(x - \\frac{1}{2}), x \\in [\\frac{1}{2}, 1] . And h(x) = f(x) - g(x) . If f(1/2) = f(0) we already found the desired x, y . If f(1/2) > f(0) , then h(1/2) > 0, h(1) < 0 . Since h(x) is continuous, according to IVF, we can find c such that h(c) = 0 . The same argument can be applied when f(1/2) < f(0) . \\square (b) Show that for each n \u2208 N there exist x_n,y_n \u2208 [0,1] with |x_n \u2212 y_n| = 1/n and f(x_n) = f(y_n) . Proof: Define h(x) = f(x) - f(x - \\frac{1}{n}), x \\in [\\frac{1}{n}, 1] . If f(\\frac{1}{n}) > f(0) , we can find 1 \\leq k \\lt n , such that h(\\frac{k}{n}) > 0 and h(\\frac{k+1}{n}) < 0 . Then we find c \\in (\\frac{k}{n}, \\frac{k+1}{n}) , such that h(c) = 0 . The same argument can be applied when f(1/n) < f(0) . \\square (c) If h \u2208 (0,1/2) is not of the form 1/n , there does not necessarily exist |x \u2212 y| = h satisfying f(x) = f(y) . Provide an example that illustrates this using h = 2/5 . Solution: Consider the following piecewise linear function. f(0) = 0 \\\\ f(\\frac{1}{5}) = -2 \\\\ f(\\frac{2}{5}) = +1 \\\\ f(\\frac{3}{5}) = -1 \\\\ f(\\frac{4}{5}) = +2 \\\\ f(1) = 0 \\\\ Think about this way, the g(x) = f(x - h) is a f(x) right shift by h . If g(x) and f(x) does not have intersection, then there does not exist |x \u2212 y| = h satisfying f(x) = f(y) . So we can construct a zig-zag piecewise linear function. Assume \\frac{1}{n+1} < h < \\frac{1}{n} and nh + \\delta = 1 and \\delta < h . f(0) = 0 \\\\ f(\\delta) = -n \\\\ f(h) = +1 \\\\ f(h + \\delta ) = -(n-1) \\\\ f(2h) = +2 \\\\ \\cdots \\\\ f(nh) = n \\\\ f(nh + \\delta) = f(1) = 0 \\\\ \\square 4.5.7 Let f be a continuous function on the closed interval [0,1] with range also contained in [0, 1] . Prove that f must have a fixed point; that is, show f(x) = x for at least one value of x \u2208 [0,1] . Proof: If f(0) = 0 , then we found it. If f(1) = 1 , we also found it. Assume f(0) > 0, f(1) < 1 , consider g(x) = f(x) - x , which is continuous and g(0) > 0, g(1) < 0 . Then according to IVT, \\exists c such that g(c) = 0 . Then f(c) = c . 4.5.8 (Inverse functions). If a function f : A \u2192 R is one-to-one, then we can define the inverse function f^{\u22121} on the range of f in the natural way: f^{\u22121}(y) = x where y = f(x) . Show that if f is continuous on an interval [a, b] and one-to-one, then f^{\u22121} is also continuous. Proof: Assume f(a) < f(b) , we first prove f is an increasing function. Assume otherwise, then we can find c < d with f(c) > f(d) . * If f(a) < f(c) , then we find a < c < d with f(a) < f(c) > f(d) . * If f(a) > f(c) , then we find c < d < b with f(c) > f(d) < f(b) . In both cases, we will find f is not one-to-one. So f has to be increasing function. If x < y and f(c) = x, f(d) = y , then c < d . That means f^{-1}(x) < f^{-1}(y) . So f^{-1} is also increasing. And f^{-1} satisfies intermediate value property. Based on exercise 4.5.3, f^{-1} is also continuous. \\square 4.6 The Intermediate Value Theorem 4.6.1. Using modifications of these functions, construct a function f : \\mathbf{R} \u2192 \\mathbf{R} so that (a) D_f = \\mathbf{Z}^c Solution: we can modify the modified Dirichlet's function f(x) = \\begin{cases} x & x \\text{ is rational}\\\\ k & x \\text{ is irrational and } x \\in (\\frac{2k-1}{2}, \\frac{2k+1}{2}) \\\\ \\end{cases} \\square (b) D_f = \\{ x: 0 < x \\leq 1\\} Solution: Consdier f(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 & x < 0 \\text{ or } x > 1\\\\ h(x) & x \\in [0, 1]\\\\ \\end{cases} \\square 4.6.2. Given a countable set A = \\{a_1,a_2,a_3,...\\} , define f(a_n) = 1/n and f(x)=0 for all x \\not \u2208A . Find D_f . Solution: D_f = A . If b \\not \\in A , then f(b) = 0 . If b is a limit point of A , then given \\epsilon , we can find N such that n > N, 1/n < \\epsilon . Then we can find \\delta , such that for n \\leq N , a_n \\not \\in V_{\\delta}(b) . Then for any x \\in V_{\\delta}(b) , f(x) < \\epsilon . So f is continuous at b . It's easier to see f is continuous at b if b is not a limit point of A . For any a_n there always exists x \\in V_{\\delta}(a_n) but x \\not \\in A for any \\delta , so f is not continuous at a_n . \\square 4.6.3 State a similar definition for the left-hand limit \\lim_{x \\to c^-} f(x) = L Solution: if for all \u03b5 > 0 there exists a \u03b4 > 0 such that |f(x)\u2212L| < \u03b5 whenever -\u03b4 < x\u2212c < 0 . Equivalently, in terms of sequences, \\lim_{x \\to c^-} f(x) = L if \\lim f(x_n) = L for all sequences (x_n) satisfying x_n < c and \\lim (x_n) = c . 4.6.4 Supply a proof for Theorem 4.6.3: Given f : A \u2192 R and a limit point c of A , \\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = L if and only if \\lim_{x \\to c^+} f(x) = L \\text{ and } \\lim_{x \\to c^-} f(x) = L. Proof: \\Rightarrow Given any sequence (x_n) satisfying x_n > c and \\lim (x_n) = c , f is continuous, then \\lim_{x \\to c} f(x_n) = L . That proves \\lim_{x \\to c^+} f(x) = L . Same thing when x_n < c . \\Leftarrow : Given any sequence (x_n) such that \\lim (x_n) = c . Then we can divide it into 2 subsequences (x^+_n) > c and (x^-_n) < c . We have the following: * \\lim (x^+_n) = c , so \\lim f(x^+_n) = L . * \\lim (x^-_n) = c , so \\lim f(x^-_n) = L . That means \\lim f(x_n) = L . \\square 4.6.5. Prove that the only type of discontinuity a monotone function can have is a jump discontinuity. Proof: Assume f is a monotonous increasing function and it's not continuous at c . * Let A = \\{f(x)|x < c\\} . f(x) is upper bounded by f(c) . Let L^- = \\sup A , then L^- = \\lim f(x^-_n) . * Let B = \\{f(x)|x > c\\} . f(x) is lower bounded by f(c) . Let L^+ = \\inf B , then L^+ = \\lim f(x^+_n) . That proves f(x) can only have jump discontinuity. 4.6.6. Construct a bijection between the set of jump discontinuities of a monotone function f and a subset of \\mathbf{Q} . Conclude that D_f for a monotone function f must either be finite or countable, but not uncountable. Proof: For any discontinuited point c , let a = \\lim_{x \\to c^+} f(x) and b = \\lim_{x \\to c^-} f(x) . Since a \\not = b , we can find a rational number q \\in (a, b) . That means this mapping is surjective. Assume c_0 < c_1 , since f is monotone increasing, we have \\lim_{x \\to c^-_0} f(x) < \\lim_{x \\to c^+_0} f(x) \\le \\lim_{x \\to c^-_1} f(x) < \\lim_{x \\to c^+_1} f(x) So basically (a_{c_i}, b_{c_i}) does not intersect with each other. Then we find a one-to-one mapping between the set of jump discontinuities and a subset of \\mathbf{Q} . So this is bijection. We proved this problem. \\square 4.6.7. In Section 4.1 we constructed functions where the set of discontinuity was \\mathbf{R} (Dirichlet\u2019s function), \\mathbf{R} \\setminus \\{0\\} (modified Dirichlet function), and \\mathbf{Q} (Thomae\u2019s function). (a) Show that in each of the above cases we get an F_\u03c3 set as the set where the function is discontinuous. Proof: Dirichlet\u2019s function: \\mathbf{R} it self is a closed set. modified Dirichlet function: \\mathbf{R} \\setminus \\{0\\} Consider A_n = (-\\infty, -1/n] \\cup [1/n, \\infty) . A_n is closed. \\cup_{n = 1}^{\\infty}A_n = \\mathbf{R} \\setminus \\{0\\} . \\mathbf{Q} (Thomae\u2019s function): A set contains a single rational number is a closed set. And \\mathbf{Q} is countable. (b) Show that the two sets of discontinuity in Exercise 4.6.1 are F_\u03c3 sets. \\mathbf{Z}^c : Consider A_n = \\{\\cup_i [i+1/n, (i+1)-1/n] | n > 2\\} A_n is countable union of closed set, so A_n is a closed set. Also \\cup A_n = \\mathbf{Z}^c . D_f = \\{ x: 0 < x \\leq 1\\} Consider A_n = \\{(-\\infty, -1/n]\\} \\\\ B = [1, \\infty) So D_f = B \\cup (\\cup A_n) . 4.6.8. Prove that, for a fixed \u03b1 > 0 , the set D_f^\u03b1 is closed. Proof: Let x be a limit point of D_f^\u03b1 . Given any \\delta , we can find a \\in U_{\\delta}(x) such that a \\in D_f^\u03b1 , since U_{\\delta}(x) is open, we can find U_{\\zeta}(a) \\subset U_{\\delta}(x) . Since a \\in D_f^\u03b1 , we can find y, z \\in U_{\\zeta}(a) with |f(y) \u2212 f(z)| \\ge \u03b1 . Since y, z \\in U_{\\delta}(x) , x is also not \u03b1 -continuous. \\square 4.6.9. If \u03b1 < \u03b1' , show that D_f^{\u03b1'} \u2286 D_f^{\u03b1} . Proof: If x \\in D_f^{\u03b1'} , then given \\delta , we can find y, z \\in V_{\\delta}(x) such that |f(y) - f(z)| > \\alpha' > \\alpha . So x \\in D_f^{\u03b1} . Then D_f^{\u03b1'} \u2286 D_f^{\u03b1} . \\square 4.6.10. Let \u03b1 > 0 be given. Show that if f is continuous at x , then it is \u03b1 -continuous at x as well. Explain how it follows that D_f^\u03b1 \u2286 D_f . Proof: If f is continuous at x , then we can find a U_{\\delta}(x) = (x\u2212\u03b4, x+\u03b4) such that |y-x| < \\alpha /2 and |z-x| < \\alpha /2 . Then |y-z| < \\alpha . So f is \u03b1 -continuous at x as well. Then given x \\in D_f^{\u03b1'} , f has to be discontinuous at x , so x \\in D_f^{\u03b1} . Then D_f^{\u03b1'} \u2286 D_f^{\u03b1} . 4.6.11. Show that if f is not continuous at x , then f is not \u03b1 -continuous for some \u03b1 > 0. Now explain why this guarantees that D_f = \\displaystyle \\cup_{n = 1}^{\\infty} D_f^{\\alpha_n} where \u03b1_n = 1/n . Proof: If f is not continuous at x , then exists \\epsilon , given any \\delta , we can find y \\in U_{\\delta}(x) such that |f(y)-f(x)| >= \\epsilon . So f is not \\epsilon -continuous at x . We can find n such that 1/n < \\epsilon . According to 4.6.9, x \\in D_f^{\\epsilon} \u2286 D_f^{1/n} .

If f is continuous at c \u2208 A , and if g is continuous at f(c) \u2208 B , then g \u25e6 f is continuous at c . 4.4 Continuous Functions on Compact Sets Theorem 4.4.1 (Preservation of Compact Sets). Let f : A \u2192 R be continuous on A . If K \u2286 A is compact, then f(K) is compact as well. Proof: Assume (y_n) is a sequence in f(K) . We can find (x_n) such that f(x_n) = y_n . Since K is compact, there is a subsequence (x_{n_k}) \\rightarrow x . Because f is continuous at x , then \\lim_{n_k \\to \\infty} y_{n_k} = f(x) \\in f(K) . So we find subsequence (y_{k_n}) \\rightarrow f(x) . So f(K) is compact. Theorem 4.4.2 (Extreme Value Theorem). If f : K \u2192 R is continuous on a compact set K \u2286 R , then f attains a maximum and minimum value. In other words, there exist x_0,x_1 \u2208 K such that f(x_0) \u2264 f(x) \u2264 f(x_1) for all x \u2208 K . Definition 4.4.4 (Uniform Continuity). A function f : A \u2192 R is uniformly continuous on A if for every \u03b5 > 0 there exists a \u03b4 > 0 such that for all x, y \u2208 A , |x\u2212y|<\u03b4 implies |f(x)\u2212f(y)|<\u03b5 . Theorem 4.4.5 (Sequential Criterion for Absence of Uniform Continuity). A function f : A \u2192 R fails to be uniformly continuous on A if and only if there exists a particular \u03b5_0 > 0 and two sequences (x_n) and (y_n) in A satisfying |x_n \u2212 y_n|\u21920 but |f(x_n)\u2212f(y_n)|\u2265\u03b5_0 . 4.5 The Intermediate Value Theorem Theorem 4.5.1 (Intermediate Value Theorem). Let f : [a,b] \u2192 R be continuous. If L is a real number satisfying f(a) < L < f(b) or f(a) > L > f(b) , then there exists a point c \u2208 (a,b) where f(c) = L . Theorem 4.5.2 (Preservation of Connected Sets). Let f : G \u2192 R be continuous. If E \u2286 G is connected, then f(E) is connected as well. Proof: Let f(E) = A \u222a B where A and B are disjoint and nonempty. Let C=\\{x\u2208E:f(x)\u2208A\\} \\text{ and } D=\\{x\u2208E:f(x)\u2208B\\} Because A, B are nonempty, so C, D are nonempty. Because A, B are disjoint, so C, D are disjoint. Also E = C \\cup D . Since E is connected, we can assume there is a sequence (x_n) \\in C such that \\lim x_n = x \\in D . Since f is continuous, then f(x_n) \\in A and \\lim f(x_n) = f(x) \\in B . So f(E) is also connected. \\square Definition 4.5.3. A function f has the intermediate value property on an interval [a,b] if for all x < y in [a,b] and all L between f(x) and f(y) , it is always possible to find a point c \u2208 (x,y) where f(c) = L . 4.6 Sets of Discontinuity Given a function f: \\mathbf{R} \u2192 \\mathbf{R} , define D_f \u2286R to be the set of points where the function f fails to be continuous. Dirichlet\u2019s function: D_f = \\mathbf{R} . Modified Dirichlet\u2019s function: D_h = \\mathbf{R} \\backslash \\{0\\} . Thomae function: D_t = \\mathbf{Q} . Definition 4.6.2. Given a limit point c of a set A and a function f : A \u2192 R , we write \\lim_{x \\to c^+} f(x) = L if for all \u03b5 > 0 there exists a \u03b4 > 0 such that |f(x)\u2212L| < \u03b5 whenever 0 < x\u2212c < \u03b4 . Equivalently, in terms of sequences, \\lim_{x \\to c^+} f(x) = L if \\lim f(x_n) = L for all sequences (x_n) satisfying x_n > c and \\lim (x_n) = c . Theorem 4.6.3. Given f : A \u2192 R and a limit point c of A , \\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = L if and only if \\lim_{x \\to c^+} f(x) = L \\text{ and } \\lim_{x \\to c^-} f(x) = L. Generally speaking, discontinuities can be divided into three categories: If \\lim_{x \\to c}f(x) exists but has a value different from f(c) , the discontinuity at c is called removable. If \\lim_{x \\to c^+}f(x) \\not = \\lim_{x \\to c^-} f(x) then f has a jump discontinuity at c . If \\lim_{x \\to c}f(x) does not exist for some other reason, then the discontinuity at c is called an essential discontinuity. D_f for an Arbitrary Function Definition 4.6.4.

(a) Explain why g'(c) in Definition 5.2.1 could have been given by g'(c) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{g(c+h) - g(c)}{h} Proof: the Definition 5.2.1 is g'(c) = \\lim_{x \\to c} \\frac{g(x) - g(c)}{x - c} For any given x we can find h such that x = c+h , so \\frac{g(x) - g(c)}{x - c} = \\frac{g(c+h) - g(c)}{(c+h)-c} = \\frac{g(c+h) - g(c)}{h} when (x) \\rightarrow c , we have (h) \\rightarrow 0 . So \\lim_{x \\to c} \\frac{g(x) - g(c)}{x - c} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{g(c+h) - g(c)}{h} \\square (b) Assume A is open. If g is differentiable at c \u2208 A , show g'(c) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{g(c+h)-g(c-h)}{2h} Proof: Similar to (a), we can show g'(c) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{g(c) - g(c-h)}{h} So 2g'(c) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{g(c+h) - g(c)}{h} + \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{g(c) - g(c-h)}{h} \\\\ = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{(g(c+h) - g(c))+(g(c) - g(c-h))}{h}\\\\ = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{g(c+h) - g(c-h)}{h} \\square 5.2.7. Let g_a(x) = \\begin{cases} x^a \\sin (1/x) &\\text{if } x \\not = 0\\\\ 0 &\\text{if } x = 0\\\\ \\end{cases} Find a particular (potentially noninteger) value for a so that (a) g_a is differentiable on \\mathbf{R} but such that g_a is unbounded on [0, 1] . Solution: g'(0) = \\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{x^a \\sin (1/x)}{x} = \\lim_{x \\to 0} x^{a-1} \\sin (1/x) \\\\ g'(c) = ac^{a-1} \\sin(1/c) - c^{a-2} \\cos (1/c) Then a = 1.5 will be good for this case. (b) g_a is differentiable on \\mathbf{R} with g'_a continuous but not differentiable at zero. g'(x) = \\begin{cases} \\lim_{x \\to 0} x^{a-1} \\sin (1/x) &\\text{if } x = 0\\\\ ax^{a-1} \\sin(1/x) - x^{a-2} \\cos (1/x) &\\text{if } x \\not = 0\\\\ \\end{cases} When a = 2.5 , g_{2.5}'(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 &\\text{if } x = 0\\\\ 2.5x^{1.5} \\sin(1/x) - x^{0.5} \\cos (1/x) &\\text{if } x \\not = 0\\\\ \\end{cases} So, g_{2.5}'(x) is continuous at 0 because \\lim_{x \\to 0} g_{2.5}'(x) = 0 = g_{2.5}'(0) But \\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{g_{2.5}'(x)}{x} = \\frac{2.5x^{1.5} \\sin(1/x) - x^{0.5} \\cos (1/x)}{x}\\\\ = 2.5x^{0.5} \\sin(1/x) - x^{-0.5} \\cos (1/x) \\rightarrow -\\infty So g_{2.5}'(x) is not differentiable at 0. (c) g_a is differentiable on \\mathbf{R} and g'_a is differentiable on \\mathbf{R} but g''_a is not continuous at zero. When a = 3.5 g_{3.5}'(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 &\\text{if } x = 0\\\\ 3.5x^{2.5} \\sin(1/x) - x^{1.5} \\cos (1/x) &\\text{if } x \\not = 0\\\\ \\end{cases}\\\\ g_{3.5}''(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 &\\text{if } x = 0\\\\ h(x) - x^{-0.5}\\sin (1/x) &\\text{if } x \\not = 0\\\\ \\end{cases}\\\\ Then \\lim_{x \\to 0} g_{3.5}''(x) does not exist. 5.2.8. Review the definition of uniform continuity (Definition 4.4.4). Given a differentiable function f : A \u2192 \\mathbf{R} , let\u2019s say that f is uniformly differentiable on A if, given \u03b5 > 0 there exists a \u03b4 > 0 such that \\left| \\frac{f(x) - f(y)}{x - y} - f'(y) \\right| < \\epsilon whenever 0 < |x-y| < \\delta . (a) Is f(x) = x^2 uniformly differentiable on \\mathbf{R} ? How about g(x) = x^3 ? Solution: \\left| \\frac{x^2 - y^2}{x - y} - 2x \\right| = |x - y| So x^2 is uniformly differentiable. \\left| \\frac{x^3 - y^3}{x-y} - 3y^2 \\right| = \\left| x^2 + xy + y^2 - 3y^2 \\right| = \\left| x^2+xy-2y^2 \\right|\\\\ = |(x + 2y)(x - y)| So x^3 is not uniformly differentiable. (b) Show that if a function is uniformly differentiable on an interval A , then the derivative must be continuous on A . Proof: Assume f is uniformly differentiable on an interval A , then for any \\epsilon , we can find \\delta such that \\left| \\frac{f(x) - f(y)}{x - y} - f'(y) \\right| < \\epsilon / 2 \\text{ and } \\left| \\frac{f(x) - f(y)}{x - y} - f'(x) \\right| < \\epsilon / 2 So |f'(x) - f'(y)| < \\epsilon , then f'(x) is continuous on A . (c) Is there a theorem analogous to Theorem 4.4.7 for differentiation? Are functions that are differentiable on a closed interval [a, b] necessarily uniformly differentiable? Proof: Again we consider g_{1.5}(x) = \\begin{cases} x^{1.5} \\sin (1/x) &\\text{if } x \\not = 0\\\\ 0 &\\text{if } x = 0\\\\ \\end{cases} and g'(x) = \\begin{cases} \\lim_{x \\to 0} x^{0.5} \\sin (1/x) = 0&\\text{if } x = 0\\\\ 1.5x^{1.5-1} \\sin(1/x) - x^{1.5-2} \\cos (1/x) &\\text{if } x \\not = 0\\\\ \\end{cases} g'(x) is not continuous at 0, so g(x) is not uniformly differentiable. 5.2.9. Decide whether each conjecture is true or false. Provide an argument for those that are true and a counterexample for each one that is false. (a) If f' exists on an interval and is not constant, then f must take on some irrational values. Proof: True. It's theorem 5.2.7 (Darboux's Theorem). (b) If f' exists on an open interval and there is some point c where f'(c) > 0 , then there exists a \u03b4 -neighborhood V_{\\delta}(c) around c in which f'(x) > 0 for all x \u2208 V_\u03b4(c) . Solution: False. Consider f(x) = \\begin{cases} 0.5x + x^2 \\sin (1/x) &\\text{if } x \\not = 0\\\\ 0 &\\text{if } x = 0\\\\ \\end{cases} \\\\ f'(x) = \\begin{cases} 0.5 + 2 x \\sin(1/x) - \\cos (1/x) &\\text{if } x \\not = 0\\\\ 0.5 &\\text{if } x = 0\\\\ \\end{cases} So when x = \\frac{1}{n \\pi } , f'(x) = -0.5 < 0 . \\square (c) If f is differentiable on an interval containing zero and if \\lim_{x \\to 0} f'(x) = L , then it must be that L = f'(0) . Proof: This proof is not correrct. I think I miss this part. * I want to prove f(x) is uniformly differentiable around 0 , i.e. given \\epsilon we can find U_{\\delta}(0) such that \\left| \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} - f'(x) \\right| < \\epsilon, \\forall x \\in U_{\\delta}(0) . f'(0) = \\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{f(x) - f(0)}{x} = L' And L' \\not = L . We also have \\left| \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} - \\frac{f(h) - f(0)}{h} \\right| \\\\ =\\frac{x}{h} \\left| \\frac{f(x+h) - f(h)}{x} - \\frac{f(x) - f(0)}{x} \\right|\\\\ \\leq \\frac{x}{h} \\left| \\frac{f(x+h) - f(h)}{x} \\right| + \\left| \\frac{f(x) - f(0)}{x} \\right| Then as long as x, h is small enough, \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} and \\frac{f(h) - f(0)}{h} can be arbitrarily close. We also have as long as x, h is small enough, \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} can be arbitrarily close L . As long as x, h is small enough, \\frac{f(x) - f(0)}{x} can be arbitrarily close L' . So it's impossible that L \\not = L' . 5.2.10. Recall that a function f : (a, b) \u2192 R is increasing on (a, b) \\text{ if } f (x) \u2264 f (y) whenever x < y in (a, b) . A familiar mantra from calculus is that a differentiable function is increasing if its derivative is positive, but this statement requires some sharpening in order to be completely accurate. Show that the function f(x) = \\begin{cases} 0.5x + x^2 \\sin (1/x) &\\text{if } x \\not = 0\\\\ 0 &\\text{if } x = 0\\\\ \\end{cases} is differentiable on \\mathbf{R} and satisfies g'(0) > 0 . Now, prove that g is not increasing over any open interval containing 0 . Proof: from 5.2.9 (b), we have f'(x) = \\begin{cases} 0.5 + 2 x \\sin(1/x) - \\cos (1/x) &\\text{if } x \\not = 0\\\\ 0.5 &\\text{if } x = 0\\\\ \\end{cases} So g'(0) = 0.5 > 0 . Consider x = \\frac{1}{n \\pi} , g'(x) < 0 . So g(x - h) > g(x) for small h . 5.2.11. Assume that g is differentiable on [a, b] and satisfies g'(a) < 0 < g'(b) . (a) Show that there exists a point x \u2208 (a, b) where g(a) > g(x) , and a point y \u2208 (a, b) where g(y) < g(b) . Proof: See my proof of Theorem 5.2.7. (b) Now complete the proof of Darboux\u2019s Theorem started earlier. Proof: See my proof of Theorem 5.2.7. 5.2.12 (Inverse functions). If f : [a, b] \u2192 \\mathbf{R} is one-to-one, then there exists an inverse function f^{\u22121} defined on the range of f given by f^{\u22121}(y) = x where y = f(x) . In Exercise 4.5.8 we saw that if f is continuous on [a,b] , then f^{\u22121} is continuous on its domain. Let\u2019s add the assumption that f is differentiable on [a,b] with f'(x) \\not = 0 for all x \u2208 [a,b] . Show f^{\u22121} is differentiable with (f^{-1})'(y) = \\frac{1}{f'(x)} \\text{ where } y = f(x). Proof: Let f^{-1} = g , and assume f(x_0) = y_0 and g(y_0) = x_0 . We want to prove g'(y_0) = 1 / f'(x_0) , i.e. 1/f'(y_0) = \\lim_{y \\to y_0} \\frac{g(y) - g(y_0)}{y - y_0} First we show give \\delta , we can find \\zeta , if y \\in V_{\\zeta}(y_0) , then x \\in V_{\\delta }(x_0) . We can refer to Exercise 4.5.8 to show f and g is monotone function first. We can prove this directly. Given sequence (y_n) \\rightarrow y_0 , and g(y_n) = x_n \\not \\in V_{\\delta }(x_0) , since (x_n) is bounded, we can find subsequence that converges to x_1 \\not = x_0 . Since f is continuous, f(x_1) = y_0 , f is not 1 to 1, we have a contradiction. Next, given \\epsilon , we show we can find \\delta , such that, x \\in U_{\\delta}(x_0) , \\left| \\frac{x - x_0}{f(x) - f(x_0)} - \\frac{1}{f'(x_0)} \\right| < \\epsilon \\square 5.3 The Mean Value Theorems 5.3.1. Recall from Exercise 4.4.9 that a function f : A \u2192 \\mathbf{R} is Lipschitz on A if there exists an M > 0 such that \\left| \\frac{f(x) - f(y)}{x-y} \\right| \\leq M for all x \\leq y in A . (a) show f is differentiable on a closed interval [a, b] and if f' is continuous on [a, b] , then f is Lipschitz on [a, b] . Proof: Since f'(x) is continuous on [a, b] , based on Extreme Value Theorem, let f'(c) = M is the maximum of |f'(x)| . Then apply the Mean Value Theorem, we have \\left| \\frac{f(x) - f(y)}{x-y} \\right| = |f'(c)| \\leq M \\square (b) Review the definition of a contractive function in Exercise 4.3.11. If we add the assumption that |f'(x)| < 1 on [a,b] , does it follow that f is contractive on this set? Proof: Since f'(x) is continuous on [a, b] , we have f'(c) = M < 1 , then f is contractive on this set. Furthermore, we can even remove the assumption that f'(x) is continuous. Assume given any n , we can find 5.3.2. Let f be differentiable on an interval A . If f'(x) \\not = 0 on A , show that f is one-to-one on A . Provide an example to show that the converse statement need not be true. Proof: If f(a) = f(b) , then we can find c \\in (a,b) such that 0 = \\frac{ f(b) - f(a) }{ b - a } = f'(c) then we have a contradiction, so f is one-to-one on A . A example is f(x) = \\cos x, x \\in [0, \\pi] . We have f'(0) = f'(\\pi) = 0 . But f is still one-to-one on A . 5.3.3. Let h be a differentiable function defined on the interval [0, 3] , and assume that h(0) = 1, h(1) = 2 , and h(3) = 2 . (a) Argue that there exists a point d \u2208 [0, 3] where h(d) = d . Proof: let f(x) = h(x) - x , f is continuous function on [0, 3] . f(1) = -1 < 0 and f(3) = 1 > 0 , according to Intermediate Value Property, we can find d \\in (1, 3) such that f(d) = 0 , so h(d) = d . (b) Argue that at some point c we have h'(c) = 1/3 Proof: Based on Mean Value theorem, we can find c such that h'(c) = \\frac{h(3) - h(0)}{3 - 0} = \\frac{1}{3} \\square (c) Argue that h'(x) = 1/4 at some point in the domain. Proof: Let g(x) = h(x) - h(x - 1), x \\in [1, 3] . We don't know what h(2) . * h(2) > 2 , then g(3) = h(3) - h(2) < 0 . h(2) = 2 , then g(2) = h(2) - h(1) = 0 . h(2) < 2 , then g(2) = h(2) - h(1) < 0 . Whatever the case, we can find some d such that g(1) = 1, g(d) \\leq 0 . Since g(x) is continuous, we can find g(c) = 1/4 . Then g'(e) = \\frac{h(c) - h(c-1)}{1} = \\frac{1}{4} \\square 5.3.4. Let f be differentiable on an interval A containing zero, and assume (x_n) is a sequence in A with (x_n) \u2192 0 and x_n \\not = 0 . (a) If f(x_n)=0 for all n\u2208N ,show f(0)=0 and f'(0)=0 . Proof: Since f(x) is continuous, we have \\lim_{x_n \\to 0} f(x_n) = f(0) , so f(0) = 0 . We also have f'(0) = \\lim_{x_n \\to 0} \\frac{f(x_n) - f(0)}{x_n - 0} = 0 \\square (b) Add the assumption that f is twice-differentiable at zero and show that f''(0)=0 as well. Proof: For x_n , according to mean value theorem, we can find y_n \\in (0, x_n) , such that 0 = \\frac{f(x_n) - f(0)}{x_n - 0} = f'(y_n) As a result, we can find (y_n) \\rightarrow 0 such that f'(y_n) = 0 . So we use (a) and we can conclude f''(0) = 0 as well. 5.3.5. (a) Supply the details for the proof of Cauchy\u2019s Generalized Mean Value Theorem (Theorem 5.3.5). Proof: Let h(x) = (f(b) - f(a))g(x) - (g(b) - g(a))f(x) Then h(b) = (f(b) - f(a))g(b) - (g(b) - g(a))f(b)\\\\ =f(b)g(a) - f(a)g(b)\\\\ and h(a) = (f(b) - f(a))g(a) - (g(b) - g(a))f(a) \\\\ = f(b)g(a) - f(a)g(b) So h(a) = h(b) , so we can find c , such that h'(c) = 0 , i.e. h'(c) = (f(b) - f(a))g'(c) - (g(b) - g(a))f'(c) = 0 Then \\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)} = \\frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)} \\square (b) Give a graphical interpretation of the Generalized Mean Value Theorem analogous to the one given for the Mean Value Theorem at the beginning of Section 5.3. (Consider f and g as parametric equations for a curve.) Solution: Consdier a curve (g(x), f(x)) . At a point c , the derivative is \\lim_{x \\to c} \\frac{f(x) - f(c)}{g(x) - g(c)} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{ \\frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x-c} }{ \\frac{g(x) - g(c)}{x-c} } = \\frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)} \\square 5.3.6. (a) Let g : [0,a] \u2192 \\mathbf{R} be differentiable, g(0) = 0 , and |g'(x)| \u2264 M for all x \u2208 [0,a] . Show |g(x)| \u2264 Mx for all x \u2208 [0,a] . Proof: When x = 0 , g(0) = 0 \\le M \\cdot 0 . When x \\not = 0 , from Mean value theorem \\left| \\frac{g(x)-g(0)}{x-0} \\right| = |g'(c)| \\le M So |g(x)| \\le Mx \\square (b) Let h : [0, a] \u2192 \\mathbf{R} be twice differentiable, h'(0) = h(0) = 0 and |h''(x)| \u2264 M for all x \u2208 [0,a] . Show |h(x)| \u2264 Mx^2/2 for all x \u2208 [0,a] . Proof: This time we need to use Generalized Mean Value Theorem. Let f(x) = Mx^2/2 From (a) we know |h'(x)| \\le Mx . \\left|\\frac{h(x)}{f(x)}\\right| = \\left| \\frac{ h(x) - h(0) }{ f(x) - f(0) } \\right| = \\left| \\frac{ h'(c) }{f'(c)} \\right| \\le \\left| \\frac{Mx}{Mx} \\right| = 1 So |h(x)| \\leq f(x) = Mx^2/2 \\square (c) Conjecture and prove an analogous result for a function that is differentiable three times on [0, a] . Solution: the conjecture should be like this: Let h : [0, a] \u2192 \\mathbf{R} be three times differentiable, h''(0) = h'(0) = h(0) = 0 and |h'''(x)| \u2264 M for all x \u2208 [0,a] . Show |h(x)| \u2264 Mx^3/6 for all x \u2208 [0,a] . Proof: We already know |h'(x)| \\leq Mx^2/2 . And let f(x) = Mx^3/6 . \\left|\\frac{h(x)}{f(x)}\\right| = \\left| \\frac{ h(x) - h(0) }{ f(x) - f(0) } \\right| = \\left| \\frac{ h'(c) }{f'(c)} \\right| \\le \\left| \\frac{Mx^2/2}{Mx^2/2} \\right| = 1 So |h(x)| \\leq f(x) = Mx^3/6 . \\square 5.3.7. A fixed point of a function f is a value x where f(x) = x . Show that if f is differentiable on an interval with f'(x) \\not = 1 , then f can have at most one fixed point. Proof: If f(x) = x, f(y) = y, x \\not = y . Then \\frac{f(x) - f(y)}{x - y} = \\frac{x - y}{x - y} = 1 We have a contradiction. \\square 5.3.8. Assume f is continuous on an interval containing zero and differentiable for all x \\not = 0 . If \\lim_{x \\to 0} f'(x) = L , show f'(0) exists and equals L . Proof: f'(0) = \\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{f(x)-f(0)}{x - 0} \\\\ = \\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)}\\\\ = L 5.3.9. Assume f and g are as described in Theorem 5.3.6, but now add the assumption that f and g are differentiable at a , and f' and g' are continuous at a with g'(a)\\not = 0 . Find a short proof for the 0/0 case of L\u2019Hospital\u2019s Rule under this stronger hypothesis.

Let f(x) = x \\sin(1/x^4) e^{\u22121/x^2} and g(x) = e^{\u22121/x^2} . Using the familiar properties of these functions, compute the limit as x approaches zero of f(x), g(x), f(x)/g(x), f'(x)/g'(x) . Solution: Let h(x) = x \\sin(1/x^4) . For x \\not = 0 , we have h'(x) = \\sin (1/x^4) + x \\cos (1/x^4) \\cdot (-4)\\cdot 1/x^5 = \\sin (1/x^4) - 4 /x^{4} \\cos (1/x^4) \\\\ g'(x) = -2 x^{-3} e^{\u22121/x^2} \\lim_{x \\to 0} f(x) = 0\\\\ \\lim_{x \\to 0} g(x) = 0\\\\ \\lim_{x \\to 0} f(x)/g(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0} h(x) = 0\\\\ See the stackexchange discussion. \\square 5.3.11. (a) Use the Generalized Mean Value Theorem to furnish a proof of the 0/0 case of L\u2019Hospital\u2019s Rule (Theorem 5.3.6). Proof: \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \\frac{f(x) - f(0)}{g(x) - g(0)} = \\frac{f'(c_x)}{g'(c_x)} Given \\epsilon > 0 , we can find \\delta , if x \\in V_{\\delta}(0) , \\left| \\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} - L \\right| < \\epsilon So we have \\lim_{x \\to a} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L \\square (b) If we keep the first part of the hypothesis of Theorem 5.3.6 the same but we assume that \\lim_{x \\to a} \\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = \\infty does it necessarily follow that \\lim_{x \\to a} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \\infty Proof: \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \\frac{f(x) - f(0)}{g(x) - g(0)} \\\\ = \\frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)}, c \\in (0, x) Since \\lim_{x \\to a} \\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = \\infty , then give N , we can find V_{\\delta}(a) , if x \\in V_{\\delta}(a) , \\lim_{x \\to a} \\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} > N , so \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} > N . That means \\lim_{x \\to a} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \\infty 5.3.12. If f is twice differentiable on an open interval containing a and f'' is continuous at a , show \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{ f(a+h) - 2 f(a) + f(a-h) }{ h^2 } = f''(a) Proof: Let g(h) = f(a+h) - 2 f(a) + f(a-h) , then g(0) = 0 , \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{ g'(h) }{2h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{ f'(a+h) - f'(a-h) }{2h} = f''(a) Another approach: \\square 5.4 A Continuous Nowhere-Differentiable Function 5.4.1. h(x) = |x|, x \\in [-1, 1] and h(x+2) = h(x) . Sketch a graph of (1/2)h(2x) on [\u22122, 3] . Give a qualitative description of the functions h_n(x) = \\frac{1}{2^n} h(2^nx) Solution: the shape of h_1(x) is similar to h(x) , it's just that the triangle edge is only 1/2 of the h(x) . For h_n(x) , they are still similar to h(x) , with the edge is only \\frac{1}{2^n} of it. 5.4.2. Fix x \u2208 \\mathbf{R} . Argue that the series \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^n} h(2^nx) converges and thus g(x) is properly defined. Proof: Let g_n(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n} \\frac{1}{2^i} h(2^ix) When x is fixed, h(2^ix) \\leq 1 , so g_n(x) \\leq 1 - \\frac{1}{2^n} . g_n(x) is increasing and has upper bound, so g_n(x) converges. \\square 5.4.3. Taking the continuity of h(x) as given, reference the proper theorems from Chapter 4 that imply that the finite sum g_m(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{m} \\frac{1}{2^n} h(2^nx) is continuous on \\mathbf{R} . Proof: First we use Theorem 4.3.9 (Composition of Continuous Functions) to derive h(2^nx) is continuous. Next we use Theorem 4.3.4 (Algebraic Continuity Theorem) to derive g_m(x) is continuous. \\square 5.4.4. As the graph in Figure 5.7 suggests, the structure of g(x) is quite intricate. Answer the following questions, assuming that g(x) is indeed continuous. (a) How do we know g attains a maximum value M on [0, 2] ? What is this value? Solution: It's a continuous function on a closed interval, so g attains a maximum value M . Let's calculate some values for x in the following format. x = \\frac{p}{2^{2m+1}}, p \\text{ is odd} The reason is for such x , g(x) has only finite terms. Because when n \\geq 2m+2 , 2^nx is an even integer, so h(2^nx) = 0 . We first prove some properties of h(x) that will be handy. (a) for x = \\frac{p}{2^{k}} , p is odd, we can find 0 < q < 2^k , such that h(\\frac{p}{2^{k}}) = h(\\frac{q}{2^{k}}) For example h(5/4) = h(3/4), h(9/4) = h(1/4) . Proof: Assume 2N+1 < \\frac{p}{2^{k}} < 2(N+1) , let \\frac{q}{2^{k}} = 2(N+1) - \\frac{p}{2^{k}} . Note that h(x) is even function and h(x + 2k) = h(x) , then we have h(\\frac{q}{2^{k}}) = h(2(N+1) - \\frac{p}{2^{k}}) = h(- \\frac{p}{2^{k}}) = h(\\frac{p}{2^{k}}) Assume 2N < \\frac{p}{2^{k}} < 2N+1 , let \\frac{q}{2^{k}} = \\frac{p}{2^{k}} - 2N then h(\\frac{q}{2^{k}}) = h(\\frac{p}{2^{k}} - 2N) = h(\\frac{p}{2^{k}}) In both cases, we have 0 < q < 2^k . \\square (b) If h(\\frac{p}{2^{k}}) = h(\\frac{q}{2^{k}}) , p, q are odd, then h(\\frac{p}{2^{l}}) = h(\\frac{q}{2^{l}}) for 0 \\leq l \\leq k . Proof: Assume 2M+1 < \\frac{p}{2^{k}} < 2(M+1) , 2N < \\frac{q}{2^{k}} < 2N+1 , we can find 0 < \\delta, \\zeta < 1 such that \\frac{p}{2^{k}} = 2M + 1 + \\delta \\\\ \\frac{q}{2^{k}} = 2N +\\zeta So we have h(1+\\delta) = h(\\zeta ) . Then we must have \\zeta = 1 - \\delta . h(\\frac{p}{2^{l}}) =\\\\ h(2^{k-l}(2M+1+\\delta )) = h(2^{k-l}\\delta )\\\\ h(\\frac{q}{2^{l}}) =\\\\ h(2^{k-l}(2N+\\zeta )) = h(2^{k-l}\\zeta )\\\\ =h(2^{k-l}(1-\\delta)) = h(-2^{k-l}\\delta) Since h is a even function, we proved this property. \\square So \\tag{1} g(x) = \\sum_{i = 0}^{2m+1} \\frac{1}{2^i} h(\\frac{p}{2^{2m+1-i}})\\\\ = \\sum_{i = 0}^{m} \\frac{1}{2^{2i}} h(\\frac{p}{2^{2m+1-2i}}) + \\frac{1}{2^{2i + 1}} h\\left( \\frac{p}{2^{2m+1-(2i+1)}} \\right) Let's first evaluate l = h \\left( \\frac{p}{2^{k+1}} \\right) + \\frac{1}{2} h \\left( \\frac{p}{2^{k}} \\right) Assume 2N < \\frac{p}{2^{k+1}} < 2N+1 , let p = q + (2N \\cdot 2^{k+1}), q < 2^{k+1} . If q < 2^k l = h\\left( \\frac{q}{2^{k+1}} \\right) + \\frac{1}{2} h\\left( \\frac{q}{2^{k}} \\right) \\\\ = \\frac{q}{2^{k+1}} + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{q}{2^{k}}\\\\ = \\frac{q}{2^{k}} < 1 If 2^k < q < 2^{k+1} l = h\\left( \\frac{q}{2^{k+1}} \\right) + \\frac{1}{2} h\\left( \\frac{q}{2^{k}} \\right) \\\\ = \\frac{q}{2^{k+1}} + \\frac{1}{2} h\\left( 2 - \\frac{q}{2^{k}} \\right)\\\\ = \\frac{q}{2^{k+1}} + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{2^{k+1} - q}{2^{k}} = 1 Assume 2N-1 < \\frac{p}{2^{k+1}} < 2N , let p = (2N \\cdot 2^{k+1}) - q, q < 2^{k+1} . If q < 2^k , knowing h is even, we have l = h\\left( \\frac{-q}{2^{k+1}} \\right) + \\frac{1}{2} h\\left( \\frac{-q}{2^{k}} \\right) \\\\ = \\frac{q}{2^{k+1}} + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{q}{2^{k}}\\\\ = \\frac{q}{2^{k}} < 1 If 2^k < q < 2^{k+1} , knowing h is even, we have l = h\\left( \\frac{-q}{2^{k+1}} \\right) + \\frac{1}{2} h\\left( \\frac{-q}{2^{k}} \\right) \\\\ = \\frac{q}{2^{k+1}} + \\frac{1}{2} h\\left( 2 - \\frac{q}{2^{k}} \\right)\\\\ = \\frac{q}{2^{k+1}} + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{2^{k+1} - q}{2^{k}} = 1 Equation (1) is bounded by \\frac{1}{4^0} + \\frac{1}{4^1} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{4^m} = \\frac{1-\\frac{1}{4^{m+1}}}{1-1/4} We can really achive this number by setting p = 2^{2m+1} - 2^{2m} + 2^{2m-1} - 2^{2m-2} + \\cdots + 2^1 - 2^0 In fact, we can have multiple p achive the maximum value. Consdier m = 1 , we can have p = 5, 7 . m = 2 , we first can have q = 5, 7, 9, 11 , because h(\\frac{11}{8})= h(\\frac{16-11}{8}) = h(\\frac{5}{8}) h(\\frac{9}{8})= h(\\frac{16-9}{8}) = h(\\frac{7}{8}) Then we have p = 32 - q = 21, 23, 25, 27 . m = 3 , we first get q_3 = 2^{2 \\times 3}-p_2 , then we get p_3 = 2^{2 \\times 3 + 1}-q_3 . This is because h(\\frac{2^{2m}-p_{m-1}}{2^{2{m-1}}}) = h(2 - \\frac{2^{2m}-p_{m-1}}{2^{2{m-1}}}) = h(\\frac{p_{m-1}}{2^{2{m-1}}}) So overall, we can find 2^m numbers to achieve \\frac{1-\\frac{1}{4^{m+1}}}{1-1/4} . The maximum value should be 4/3 . \\square (b) Let D be the set of points in [0,2] where g attains its maximum. That is D= {x \u2208 [0,2] : g(x) = M} . Find one point in D . Solution: Consider x_m = \\frac{p}{2^{2m+1}} where p = 2^{2m+1} - 2^{2m} + 2^{2m-1} - 2^{2m-2} + \\cdots + 2^1 - 2^0 =2^{2m} + 2^{2m-2} + \\cdots + 1 \\\\ \\frac{2^{2m+2} - 1}{3} So \\lim_{m \\to \\infty} x_m = 2/3 . We can verify it g(2/3) = h(\\frac{2}{3}) + 1/2 h(\\frac{4}{3}) + 1/4 h(\\frac{8}{3}) + \\cdots = \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} + \\cdots \\\\ = \\frac{2}{3} (1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\cdots ) = \\frac{4}{3} \\square (c) Is D finite, countable, or uncountable? Solution: I think it is uncountable. Because we can find 2^m numbers to achieve \\frac{1-\\frac{1}{4^{m+1}}}{1-1/4} . 5.4.6. (a) Modify the previous argument to show that g'(1) does not exist. Show that g'(1/2) does not exist. Proof: h(2^{i}(1+\\frac{1}{2^m})) - h(2^i) = h(\\frac{1}{2^{m-i}}) = \\frac{1}{2^{m-i}} So \\frac{g(1+x_m) - g(1)}{(1+x_m)-1} =\\\\ \\frac{ \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^i} \\left( h(2^{i}(1+x_m)) - h(2^i) \\right) }{x_m} =\\\\ \\frac{ \\sum_{i=0}^{m} \\frac{1}{2^i} \\frac{1}{2^{m-i}} }{ x_m } = m + 1 \\square (b) Show that g'(x) does not exist for any rational number of the form x = p/2^k where p \u2208 Z and k \u2208 N\u222a\\{0\\} . Proof: The idea is to choose m big enough such that 2^i(x+\\frac{1}{2^m}) and 2^ix are at the same segment of h(x) . h_i(x) = h(2^i(x+\\frac{1}{2^m})) - h(2^ix)\\\\ = h(\\frac{p}{2^{k-i}} + \\frac{1}{2^{m-i}}) - h(\\frac{p}{2^{k-i}})\\\\ This value depends on i . So when 0 \\leq i \\leq k , h_i(x) can be \\pm x_{m-i} , but when k < i \\leq m , h_i(x) = x_{m-i} . So \\frac{ g(x+x_m) - g(x) }{ x_m } \\geq m - 2(k+1) \\square 5.4.7. (a) First prove the following general lemma: Let f be defined on an open interval J and assume f is di\ufb00erentiable at a \u2208 J . If (a_n) and (b_n) are sequences satisfying a_n < a < b_n and \\lim a_n = \\lim b_n = a , show f'(a) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{ f(b_n) - f(a_n) }{ b_n - a_n } Proof: \\left| \\frac{ f(b_n) - f(a_n) }{ b_n - a_n } - f'(a) \\right| = \\\\ \\left| \\frac{b_n - a}{b_n - a_n} \\frac{f(b_n) - f(a)}{b_n - a} - \\frac{b_n - a}{b_n - a_n} f'(a) \\\\ +\\\\ \\frac{a - a_n}{b_n - a_n} \\frac{f(a) - f(a_n)}{a - a_n} - \\frac{a - a_n}{b_n - a_n} f'(a) \\right| \\leq \\\\ \\left| \\frac{b_n - a}{b_n - a_n} \\left( \\frac{f(b_n) - f(a)}{b_n - a} - f'(a) \\right) \\right| + \\left| \\frac{a - a_n}{b_n - a_n} \\left( \\frac{f(a) - f(a_n)}{a - a_n} - f'(a) \\right) \\right| \\leq \\\\ \\left| \\frac{f(b_n) - f(a)}{b_n - a} - f'(a) \\right| + \\left| \\frac{f(a) - f(a_n)}{a - a_n} - f'(a) \\right| < \\epsilon + \\epsilon \\square (b) Now use this lemma to show that g'(x) does not exist. Proof: We first check some values, say x = \\frac{2}{3} . \\frac{5}{8} < \\frac{2}{3} < \\frac{6}{8} . 8 \\times (g(\\frac{6}{8}) - g(\\frac{5}{8})) = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 = 0 Then we also have \\frac{10}{16} < \\frac{2}{3} < \\frac{11}{16} , so 16 \\times (g(\\frac{11}{16}) - g(\\frac{10}{16})) = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 = 5 As we can see \\frac{1}{2^n}\\left( g(\\frac{ p_n+1 }{2^n}) - g(\\frac{ p_n }{2^n}) \\right) is a even number when n is odd, and an odd number when n is even. So this sequence does not converges.

Using the Cauchy Criterion for convergent sequences of real numbers (Theorem 2.6.4), supply a proof for Theorem 6.2.5. (First, define a candidate for f(x) , and then argue that f_n \u2192 f uniformly.) Proof: \\Rightarrow Since (f_n(x)) \\rightarrow f(x) uniformly for x \\in A . Then given \\epsilon , we can find N , for all n > N and x \\in A , |f_n(x) - f(x)| < \\epsilon/2 . So \\left| f_n(x) - f_m(x) \\right| \\\\ = \\left| f_n(x) - f(x) + f(x) - f_m(x) \\right| \\\\ \\leq \\left| f_n(x) - f(x) \\right| + \\left| f(x) - f_m(x) \\right| \\\\ < \\epsilon for all m, n > N and x \\in A . \\Leftarrow if given any \\epsilon , we can find N , for all m, n > N and x \\in A , |f_n(x) - f_m(x)| < \\epsilon , then (f_n(x)) is a Cauchy sequence, so it must converge to some c_x , then define f(x) = c_x . We can find another N_1 , for all m, n > N_1 and x \\in A , |f_n(x) - f_m(x)| < \\epsilon/2 . We can show that |f_n(x) - f(x)| < \\epsilon . This is because for any given x \\in A , since (f_n(x)) \\rightarrow f(x) , we can find k , such that k > N_1 and |f_k(x) - f(x)| < \\epsilon/2 . So \\left| f_n(x) - f(x) \\right| \\\\ \\leq \\left| f_n(x) - f_k(x) \\right| + \\left| f_k(x) - f(x) \\right| \\\\ < \\epsilon Thus, f_n \u2192 f uniformly. \\square 6.2.6. Assume f_n \u2192 f on a set A . (a) If each f_n is uniformly continuous, then f is uniformly continuous. Solution : Consider the example of 6.2.2 (ii), each f_n is uniformly continuous on [0, 1] , but f is not a continuous function. Now assume (f_n) \\rightarrow f uniformly. We can find n such that |f_n(x) - f(x)| < \\epsilon / 3 for x \\in A . For this f_n , since it's uniformly continuous, we can find \\delta , if |x - y| < \\delta , then |f_n(x) - f_n(y)| < \\epsilon / 3 . Then we have |f(x) - f(y)| \\leq \\\\ |f(x) - f_n(x)| + |f_n(x) - f_n(y)| + |f_n(y) - f(y)| \\lt \\\\ \\epsilon / 3 + \\epsilon / 3 + \\epsilon / 3 = \\epsilon So f is uniformly continuous. \\square (b) If each f_n is bounded, then f is bounded. Solution : Consider f_n = \\frac{1}{1/n + x} , A = (0, 1] . Then f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} on A = (0, 1] which is not bounded. If (f_n) \\rightarrow f uniformly. We can find n , |f_n(x) - f(x) | < 1 , since |f_n(x)| \\leq M , then |f(x)| \\leq M + 1 . \\square (c) If each f_n has a finite number ofdiscontinuities, then f has a finite number of discontinuities. Proof: If the convergence is uniform, consider the following f_n defined on [0, 1] . f_n(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 &\\text{if } x \\not \\in \\mathbf{Q} \\\\ 1/p - 1/n &\\text{if } x = q/p, p < n \\\\ 0 &\\text{if } x = q/p, p \\geq n \\\\ \\end{cases} So we have f(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 &\\text{if } x \\not \\in \\mathbf{Q} \\\\ 1/p &\\text{if } x = q/p \\\\ \\end{cases} each f_n(x) has a finite number of discontinuities, but f(x) is not continuous at all rational numbers. Also note |f_n(x) - f(x)| \\leq 1/n , so the convergence is uniform. \\square (d) If each f_n has fewer than M discontinuities (where M \u2208 N is fixed), then f has fewer than M discontinuities. Solution : Consider f_n(x) = x^n defined on [0, 1] , it has no discontinuities on [0, 1] . However, f(x) is discontinueous at 1 , so it has one discontinuity. When f_n(x) \\rightarrow f(x) uniformly, and assume f(x) has M or more than M discontinuities. We first need to choose \\epsilon . Since we can find at least M discontinuities, let \\epsilon = \\min \\left\\{ \\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_2, \\cdots, \\epsilon_M \\right\\} We then choose a fixed n such that |f_n(x) - f(x) | < \\epsilon / 3 for all x \\in A . Assume c is continuous in f_n(x) but is discontinueous in f(x) . Then we can find a \\delta such that x \\in U_{\\delta}(c) , |f_n(x) - f_n(c) | < \\epsilon / 3 . Finally, since f(x) is not continuous at c , then we can find x_0 \\in U_{\\delta}(c) and |f(x) - f(c)| \\geq \\epsilon . But on the other hand, |f(c) - f(x_0)| \\\\ < |f(c) - f_n(c) | + | f_n(c) - f_n(x_0) | + | f_n(x_0) - f(x_0) | \\\\ < \\epsilon / 3 + \\epsilon / 3 + \\epsilon / 3 \\\\ = \\epsilon We have a contradiction. So f(x) has fewer than M discontinuities. Now looking back to (c), the arguments in (d) does not hold because, we cannot find such \\epsilon . \\square (e) If each f_n has at most a countable number of discontinuities, then f has at most a countable number of discontinuities. Solution : Consdier the process of constructing the Cantor set, and define f_n(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 &\\text{if } x \\in C_n\\\\ 0 &\\text{otherwise }\\\\ \\end{cases} Then f(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 &\\text{if } x \\in C\\\\ 0 &\\text{otherwise}\\\\ \\end{cases} Each f_n has 2^n discontinuities, but f is discontinueous at all x \\in C which is an uncountable set. I cannot figure out the results when the convergence is uniform. \\square 6.2.7. Let f be uniformly continuous on all of \\mathbf{R} , and define a sequence of functions by f_n(x) = f(x+ 1/n) . Show that f_n \u2192 f uniformly. Give an example to show that this proposition fails if f is only assumed to be continuous and not uniformly continuous on \\mathbf{R} . Proof : Since f is uniformly continuous on all of \\mathbf{R} , then given \\epsilon , we can find \\delta , if |x - y| < \\delta , |f(x) - f(y)| < \\epsilon . So take 1/n < \\delta , we have |f_n(x) - f(x)| \\\\ = |f(x+1/n) - f(x) | < \\epsilon So f_n \u2192 f uniformly. Let f(x) = x^2 (x + 1/n)^2 - x^2 = \\frac{2}{n}x + \\frac{1}{n^2} So f_n \u2192 f is not uniformly. \\square 6.2.8. Let (g_n) be a sequence of continuous functions that converges uniformly to g on a compact set K . If g(x) \\not = 0 on K , show (1/g_n) converges uniformly on K to 1/g . Proof: since (g_n) \\rightarrow g uniformly, and g_n is continuous, then g is a continuous function on a compact set K , that means we can find c \\in K , such that g(c) = \\inf \\left\\{ |g(x)| : x \\in K \\right\\} > 0 Again, since (g_n) \\rightarrow g uniformly, given \\epsilon < g(c)/2 , we can find N , such that n > N , |g_n(x) - g(x)| < \\epsilon . That is |g_n(x)| > g(c)/2 . So we have |\\frac{1}{g_n(x)} - \\frac{1}{g(x)}|\\\\ = |\\frac{g(x) - g_n(x)}{g(x)g_n(x)}| < \\frac{4}{g^2(c)} | g(x) - g_n(x)| So (1/g_n) converges uniformly on K to 1/g . \\square 6.2.9. Assume (f_n) and (g_n) are uniformly convergent sequences of functions. (a) Show that (f_n +g_n) is a uniformly convergent sequence of functions. Proof : \\left| f_n(x) + g_n(x) - (f(x) + g(x)) \\right| \\\\ < |f_n(x) - f(x)| + |g_n(x) - g(x)| \\\\ < 2 \\epsilon So (f_n +g_n) is a uniformly convergent sequence of functions. (b) Give an example to show that the product (f_ng_n) may not converge uniformly. Solution : Let f_n(x) = g_n(x) = x + 1/n , (f_ng_n) \\rightarrow x^2 , but is not uniformly. (c) Prove that if there exists an M > 0 such that |f_n| \u2264 M and |g_n| \u2264 M for all n \u2208 N , then (f_ng_n) does converge uniformly. Proof : |f_ng_n - fg|\\\\ =|f_ng_n - f g_n + f g_n - fg|\\\\ =|f_n - f| |g_n| + |f| |g_n - g|\\\\ \\leq M(|fn - f| + |g_n - g|) So (f_ng_n) does converge uniformly. \\square 6.2.10. This exercise and the next explore partial converses of the Continuous Limit Theorem (Theorem 6.2.6). Assume f_n \u2192 f pointwise on [a,b] and the limit function f is continuous on [a,b] . If each f_n is increasing (but not necessarily continuous), show f_n \u2192 f uniformly. Proof: Assume otherwise. Then we can find a \\epsilon , for any N , we can find n > N and x_n \\in [a, b] , such that |f_n(x_n) - f(x_n)| \\geq \\epsilon . Thus we found a sequence (x_n) . Since it's bounded, we can find a subsquence (x_n) \\rightarrow c . On the other hand, for c \\in [a, b] , since f(x) is continuous, we can find [c-\\delta, c+ \\delta] , such that |f(x) - f(c)| < \\epsilon if x \\in [c-\\delta, c+ \\delta] . We can also find N , if n > N , |f_n(c-\\delta) - f(c-\\delta)| < \\epsilon and |f_n(c+\\delta) - f(c+\\delta)| < \\epsilon . For any n > N and x \\in [c-\\delta, c+ \\delta] , since f_n is increasing, we have |f_n(x) - f(x)| < \\max (|f_n(c-\\delta) - f(x)|, |f_n(c+\\delta) - f(x)|) . |f_n(c-\\delta) - f(x)| \\leq |f_n(c-\\delta) - f(c-\\delta)| + |f(c-\\delta) - f(x)| \\\\ \\leq |f_n(c-\\delta) - f(c-\\delta)| + |f(c-\\delta) - f(c)| + |f(c) - f(x)| \\\\ < 3 \\epsilon For the same reason, we have |f_n(c+\\delta) - f(x)| < 3 \\epsilon . Thus, |f_n(x) - f(x)| < 3 \\epsilon . \\square 6.2.11 (Dini\u2019s Theorem). Assume f_n \u2192 f pointwise on a compact set K and assume that for each x \u2208 K the sequence f_n(x) is increasing. Follow these steps to show that if f_n and f are continuous on K , then the convergence is uniform. (a) Set g_n = f\u2212 f_n and translate the preceding hypothesis into statements about the sequence (g_n) . New statement: g_n \u2192 0 pointwise on a compact set K and assume that for each x \u2208 K the sequence g_n(x) is decreasing. If g_n are continuous on K , then the convergence is uniform. (b) Let \u03f5 > 0 be arbitrary, and define K_n = \\left\\{ x \u2208 K : g_n(x) \u2265 \u03f5 \\right\\} . Argue that K_1 \u2287 K_2 \u2287 K_3 \u2287 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 , and use this observation to finish the argument. Proof: If c \\in K_n , g_n(c) \\geq \\epsilon . Since g_n(c) is decreasing, then g_n(c) \\leq g_m(c), \\forall m < n . That means K_m \\supseteq K_n . K_n = g_n^{-1}([\\epsilon, \\infty)) , so K_n is the preimage of a closed set of a continuous function. It's easy to prove K_n is also a close set. Since it's a subset of K , it's also bounded. Then K_n is compact. If none of K_n is empty, then according to Theorem 3.3.5 (Nested Compact Set Property), the intersection of K_n is not empty. Assume c \\in \\cap K_n , then g_n(c) \\geq \\epsilon . So g(c) \\geq \\epsilon . We have a contradiction. This means for some N , as long as n > N , K_n = \\emptyset , i.e. 0 < g_n(x) < \\epsilon, x \\in K , i.e. the convergence is continuous. \\square 6.2.12 (Cantor Function). Review the construction of the Cantor set C \u2286 [0,1] from Section 3.1. This exercise makes use of results and notation from this discussion. (a) Define f_0(x) = x for all x \\in [0,1] . Now, let f_1(x) = \\begin{cases} (3/2)x &\\text{for } 0 \\leq x \\leq 1/3\\\\ 1/2 &\\text{for } 1/3 < x < 2/3 \\\\ (3/2)x - 1/2 &\\text{for } 2/3 \\leq x \\leq 1\\\\ \\end{cases} Sketch f_0 and f_1 over [0,1] and observe that f_1 is continuous, increasing, and constant on the middle third (1/3,2/3)= [0,1] / C_1 . (b) Construct f_2 by imitating this process of flattening out the middle third of each nonconstant segment of f_1 . Specifically, let f_2(x) = \\begin{cases} (1/2)f_1(3x) &\\text{for } 0 \\leq x \\leq 1/3\\\\ f_1(x) &\\text{for } 1/3 < x < 2/3 \\\\ (1/2)f_1(3x-2) + 1/2 &\\text{for } 2/3 \\leq x \\leq 1\\\\ \\end{cases} If we continue this process,show that the resulting sequence (f_n) converges uniformly on [0,1] . Proof: For f_n , each vertical non-flat jump is 1/2^n . Then: * if x \\not \\in C_n , f_n(x) = f(x) . * if x \\in C_n , |f_n(x) - f(x)| \\leq 1/2^n . So (f_n) converges uniformly on [0,1] . (c) Let f = \\lim f_n . Prove that f is a continuous, increasing function on [0,1] with f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 1 that satisfies f'(x) = 0 for all x in the open set [0,1]/C . Recall that the \u201clength\u201d of the Cantor set C is 0 . Somehow, f manages to increase from 0 to 1 while remaining constant on a set of \u201clength 1 .\u201d Proof: Each f_n is continuous and (f_n) \\rightarrow f uniformly, according to Theorem 6.2.6 (Continuous Limit Theorem), f is continuous. f_n is increasing, so is f . f_n(0) = 0 and f_n(1) = 1 , so f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1 . If x \\in [0,1]/C , then f(x) is a constant in U_{\\delta}(x) , so f'(x) = 0 . \\square 6.2.13. Let A= \\left\\{x_1,x_2,x_3,...\\right\\} be a countable set. For each n \u2208 N , let f_n be defined on A and assume there exists an M > 0 such that |f_n(x)| \u2264 M for all n \u2208 N and x \u2208 A . Follow these steps to show that there exists a subsequence of (f_n) that converges pointwise on A . (a) Why does the sequence of real numbers f_n(x_1) necessarily contain a convergent subsequence (f_{n_k}) ? To indicate that the subsequence of functions (f_{n_k}) is generated by considering the values of the functions at x_1 , we will use the notation (f_{n_k}) = f_{1,k} . Proof: f_n(x_1) is a bounded sequence, from Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass Theorem, it must have a convergent subsequence (f_{n_k}) . (b) Now,explain why the sequence f_{1,k}(x2) contains a convergent subsequence. Proof: Because f_{1,k}(x2) is also bounded. And use Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass Theorem again. (c) Carefully construct a nested family of subsequences (f_{m,k}) , and show how this can be used to produce a single subsequence of (f_n) that converges at every point of A . Proof: Note that f_{p,k} \\subseteq f_{q,k} if p > q , and f_{p, k} (x_q) converges. So we can pick f_1 from f_{1, k} , f_2 from f_{2, k} and so on. For any x_n \\in A , f_n(x_n), f_{n+1}(x_n), \\dots converges. \\square 6.2.14. A sequence of functions (f_n) defined on a set E \u2286 R is called equicontinuous if for every \u03f5 > 0 there exists a \u03b4 > 0 such that |f_n(x)\u2212f_n(y)| < \u03f5 for all n \u2208 N and |x\u2212y| < \u03b4 in E . (a) What is the di\ufb00erence between saying that a sequence of functions (f_n) is equicontinuous and just asserting that each f_n in the sequence is individually uniformly continuous? Solution: the \\delta might be depending on n if each f_n in the sequence is individually uniformly continuous. (b) Give a qualitative explanation for why the sequence g_n(x) = x^n is not equicontinuous on [0,1] . Is each g_n uniformly continuous on [0,1] ? Solution: let \\epsilon = 0.1 * when n = 1 , \\delta = 0.1 . * when n = 2 , 1 - x^2 < 0.1, x < \\sqrt[2]{1 - 0.1} , \\delta < 0.051 . * when n = 4 , 1 - x^4 < 0.1, x < \\sqrt[4]{1 - 0.1} , \\delta < 0.026 . * when n = 100 , 1 - x^{100} < 0.1, x < \\sqrt[100]{1 - 0.1} , \\delta < 0.0011 . But each g_n is indeed uniformly continuous. 6.2.15 (Arzela\u2013Ascoli Theorem). For each n \u2208 \\mathbf{N} , let f_n be a function defined on [0,1] . If (f_n) is bounded on [0,1] \u2014that is, there exists an M > 0 such that |f_n(x)| \u2264 M for all n \u2208 \\mathbf{N} and x \u2208 [0,1] \u2014and if the collection of functions (f_n) is equicontinuous (Exercise 6.2.14), follow these steps to show that (f_n) contains a uniformly convergent subsequence. (a) Use Exercise 6.2.13 to produce a subsequence (f_{n,k}) that converges at every rational point in [0,1] . To simplify the notation, set g_k = f_{n,k} . It remains to show that (g_k) converges uniformly on all of [0,1] . Proof: We can just directly apply Exercise 6.2.13. \\square (b) Let \u03f5 > 0 . By equicontinuity, there exists a \u03b4 > 0 such that |g_k(x) - g_k(y)| < \\epsilon / 3 for all |x\u2212 y| < \u03b4 and k \u2208 \\mathbf{N} . Using this \u03b4 , let r_1,r_2,...,r_m be a finite collection of rational points with the property that the union of the neighborhoods V_\u03b4(r_i) contains [0,1] . Explain why there must exist an N \u2208 \\mathbf{N} such that |g_s(r_i) - g_t(r_i)| < \\epsilon / 3 for all s,t \u2265 N and r_i in the finite subset of [0,1] just described. Why does having the set \\left\\{r_1,r_2,...,r_m\\right\\} be finite matter? Proof : This is because g_k(r_i) \\rightarrow g(r_i) , according to Cauchy criterion, we can find N_i such that s, t > N_i |g_s(r_i) - g_t(r_i)| < \\epsilon / 3 Let N = \\max \\left\\{ r_1,r_2,...,r_m \\right\\} . If \\left\\{r_1,r_2,...,\\right\\} is infinite, \\max \\left\\{ r_1,r_2,... \\right\\} can be infinite. \\square (c) Finish the argument by showing that, for an arbitrary x \u2208 [0,1] , |g_s(x) - g_t(x)| < \\epsilon for all s,t \u2265 N . Proof : |g_s(x) - g_t(x)| = |g_s(x) - g_s(r_i) + g_s(r_i) - g_t(r_i) + g_t(r_i) - g_t(x)|\\\\ \\leq |g_s(x) - g_s(r_i)| + |g_s(r_i) - g_t(r_i)| + |g_t(r_i) - g_t(x)| \\\\ < 3 \\times \\epsilon / 3 = \\epsilon \\square 6.3. Uniform Convergence and Di\ufb00erentiation 6.3.1. Consider the sequence of functions defined by g_n(x) = \\frac{x^n}{n} Anwser: (a) Show (g_n) converges uniformly on [0,1] and find g = \\lim g_n . Show that g is di\ufb00erentiable and compute g'(x) for all x \u2208 [0,1] . Solution : Given x \\in [0, 1] , \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{x^n}{n} = 0 So g(x) = 0 . |g_n(x) - g(x)| = \\left| \\frac{x^n}{n} \\right| < \\left| 1/n \\right| So (g_n) \\rightarrow g uniformly. g is a constant function so it's differentiable and g'(x) = 0 . \\square (b) Now, show that (g_n') converges on [0,1] . Is the convergence uniform? Set h = \\lim g_n' and compare h and g' . Are they the same? Solution : We have g'_n(x) = x^{n-1} \\\\ h(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 &\\text{if } x < 1\\\\ 1 &\\text{if } x = 1\\\\ \\end{cases} The converge is not uniform. h and g'(x) are not the same. \\square 6.3.2. Consider the sequence of functions h_n(x) = \\sqrt[]{x^2 + \\frac{1}{n}} Answer: (a) Compute the pointwise limit of (h_n) and then prove that the convergence is uniform on \\mathbf{R} . Solution : Given x h(x) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} h_n(x) = \\sqrt[]{x^2} = |x| And also |h_n(x) - h(x)| =\\\\ \\left| \\frac{1/n}{\\sqrt[]{x^2 + \\frac{1}{n}} + |x|} \\right| < \\left| \\frac{1/n}{\\sqrt[]{1/n}} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[]{n}} \\right| So the convergence is uniform. \\square (b) Note that each h_n is di\ufb00erentiable. Show g(x) = \\lim h'_ n(x) exists for all x , and explain how we can be certain that the convergence is not uniform on any neighborhood of zero. Solution : h_n'(x) = \\left( \\sqrt[]{x^2 + \\frac{1}{n}} \\right) ' \\\\ = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[]{x^2 + \\frac{1}{n}}} 2x \\\\ = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt[]{x^2 + \\frac{1}{n}}} Then we have g(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 &\\text{if } x = 0\\\\ 1 &\\text{if } x > 0\\\\ -1 &\\text{if } x < 0\\\\ \\end{cases} If the convergence is uniform on a neighborhood of zero, then we must have h'(x) = g(x) But h(x) is not differentiable at 0 . So the convergence is not uniform. \\square 6.3.3. Consider the sequence of functions f_n(x) = \\frac{x}{1 + nx^2} Answer: (a) Find the points on \\mathbf{R} where each f_n(x) attains its maximum and minimum value. Use this to prove (f_n) converges uniformly on \\mathbf{R} . What is the limit function? Solution : Fix n , and assume x > 0 . f_n(x) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x} + nx} \\\\ = \\frac{1}{(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[]{x}} - \\sqrt[]{nx})^2 + 2 \\sqrt[]{n}} \\\\ \\leq \\frac{1}{2 \\sqrt[]{n}} When x = 1/\\sqrt[]{n} . Since f_n(x) is odd function, it attains it's minimum value at x = -1/\\sqrt[]{n} . The limit function is f(x) = 0 . |f_n(x) - f(x)| = \\left| \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x} + nx} - 0 \\right| \\leq \\frac{1}{2 \\sqrt[]{n}} So the convergence is uniform. (b) Let f = \\lim f_n . Compute f'_n(x) and find all the values of x for which f'(x) = \\lim f'_n(x) . Solution : f_n(x) = \\frac{x}{1 + nx^2} \\\\ f_n'(x) = \\frac{ (1+nx^2) - x(2nx) }{ (1 + nx^2)^2 } \\\\ = \\frac{1 - nx^2}{(1 + nx^2)^2} \\\\ = \\frac{1}{1 + nx^2} \\frac{1 - nx^2}{1+nx^2} Let g(x) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_n'(x) , g(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 &\\text{if } x \\not = 0 \\\\ 0 &\\text{if } x = 0 \\\\ \\end{cases} So f'(x) = g(x) when x \\not = 0 . 6.3.4. Let h_n(x) = \\frac{\\sin (nx)}{\\sqrt[]{n}} Show that h_n \u2192 0 uniformly on \\mathbf{R} but that the sequence of derivatives (h_n') diverges for every x \u2208 \\mathbf{R} . Proof : |h_n(x) - 0| \\leq \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[]{n}} So the converge is uniform. h_n'(x) = \\frac{n \\cos (nx)}{\\sqrt[]{n}} = \\sqrt[]{n} \\cos (nx) Since \\cos (nx) can be either positive or negtive, then h_n'(x) diverges for every x \\in \\mathbf{R} . \\square 6.3.5. Let g_n(x) = \\frac{nx + x^2}{2n} and set g(x) = \\lim g_n(x) . Show that g is di\ufb00erentiable in two ways: (a) Compute g(x) by algebraically taking the limit as n \u2192 \u221e and then find g'(x) . Solution : g(x) = \\lim g_n(x) = \\frac{x}{2} \\\\ g'(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\square (b) Compute g'_n(x) for each n \u2208 N and show that the sequence of derivatives (g'_n) converges uniformly on every interval [\u2212M,M] . Solution : g_n'(x) = \\frac{n + 2x}{2n} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{x}{n} We can see \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} g_n'(x) = \\frac{1}{2} for x \\in \\mathbf{R} . |g_n'(x) - \\frac{1}{2}| = |x/n| \\leq M/n. So it converges uniformly on every interval [\u2212M,M] . \\square (c) Repeat parts (a) and (b) for the sequence f_n(x) = (nx^2 +1)/(2n+x) . Solution : f(x) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_n(x) = \\frac{x^2}{2} Then we have f'(x) = x . Then we compute f_n'(x) . f_n(x) = \\frac{nx^2 +1}{2n + x} \\\\ f_n'(x) = \\frac{(2n+x)(2nx) - (nx^2+1)}{(2n+x)^2} \\\\ = \\frac{nx^2 + 4n^2x - 1}{(2n+x)^2} \\\\ = \\frac{nx^2 + 4n^2x - 1}{x^2 + 4nx + 4n^2} Let h(x) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_n'(x) , then h(x) = x . |f_n'(x) - h(x)| =\\\\ \\left| \\frac{ (nx^2 + 4n^2x - 1) - (x^2 + 4nx + 4n^2)x }{ x^2 + 4nx + 4n^2 } \\right| = \\\\ \\left| \\frac{ 3nx^2 + x^3 + 1 }{ x^2 + 4nx + 4n^2 } \\right| < \\frac{3nM^2 + M^3 + 1}{(2n - M)^2} So it converges uniformly on every interval [\u2212M,M] . \\square 6.3.7. Use the Mean Value Theorem to supply a proof for Theorem 6.3.2. To get started, observe that the triangle inequality implies that, for any x \u2208 [a,b] and m,n \u2208 \\mathbf{N} , |f_n(x) - f_m(x)| \\leq |(f_n(x) - f_m(x)) - (f_n(x_0) - f_m(x_0))| + |(f_n(x_0) - f_m(x_0))| Proof : Fix x , since f_n are all differentiable, from MVT, we can find c \\in (x, x_0) such that |(f_n(x) - f_m(x)) - (f_n(x_0) - f_m(x_0))| =\\\\ |(f_n'(c) - f_m'(c))(x - x_0)| \\\\ \\leq |(f_n'(c) - f_m'(c))| (b-a) Let g(x) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_n'(x) , since we (f'_n) \\rightarrow g uniformly, we can find N_1 , for n, m > N_1 , |f_n'(x) - f_m'(x)| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{2 (b-a)} . We can also find N_2 , for n, m > N_2 , |f_n(x_0) - f_m(x_0)| < \\epsilon /2 . Let N = \\max \\left\\{ N_1, N_2 \\right\\} , then |f_n(x) - f_m(x)| < \\epsilon . \\square 6.4 Series of Functions 6.4.1. Supply the details for the proof of the Weierstrass M-Test (Corollary 6.4.5): For each n \u2208 N , let f_n be a function defined on a set A \u2286 R , and let M_n > 0 be a real number satisfying |f_n(x)| \\leq M_n for all x \\in A . If \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty}M_n converges, then \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty}f_n(x) converges uniformly on A . Proof : Given \\epsilon , since \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty}M_n converges, based on Cauchy Criterion, we can find N , if n > m > N , then \\left| M_{m+1} + \\cdots + M_{n} \\right| =\\\\ M_{m+1} + \\cdots + M_{n} < \\epsilon We also have \\left| f_{m+1} + \\cdots + f_{n} \\right| \\leq \\left| M_{m+1} \\right| + \\cdots + \\left| M_{n} \\right| =\\\\ M_{m+1} + \\cdots + M_{n} < \\epsilon So based on Theorem 6.4.4 (Cauchy Criterion for Uniform Convergence of Series), \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty}f_n(x) converges uniformly on A . \\square 6.4.2. Decide whether each proposition is true or false, providing a short justification or counterexample as appropriate. (a) If \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty} g_n converges uniformly, then (g_n) converges uniformly to zero. Proof : True. Based on Theorem 6.4.4 (Cauchy Criterion for Uniform Convergence of Series), we know \\left| g_n(x) \\right| < \\epsilon . \\square (b) If 0 \\leq f_n(x) \\leq g_n(x) and \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty}g_n converges uniformly, then \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty}f_n(x) converges uniformly. Proof : True, again, use Theorem 6.4.4 (Cauchy Criterion for Uniform Convergence of Series) \\left| f_{m+1} (x) + \\cdots + f_n(x) \\right| =\\\\ f_{m+1} (x) + \\cdots + f_n(x) \\\\ \\leq g_{m+1} (x) + \\cdots + g_n(x) \\\\ = | g_{m+1} (x) + \\cdots + g_n(x) | < \\epsilon \\square (c) If \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty} f_n converges uniformly on A , then there exist constants M_n such that |f_n(x)| \\leq M_n for all x \\in A and \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty}M_n converges. Solution : Let f_1(x) = x , for n > 1, f_n(x) = 0 . \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty} f_n converges to x , but we cannot find M_1 such that |f_1(x)| \\leq M_1 for all x \\in A . This is a boring example, a more interested example is presented here . It constructs M_n like this: M_1 = 1 \\\\ M_2 = M_3 = 1/2 \\\\ M_4 = M_5 = M_6 = M_7 = 1/4 \\\\ \\cdots Then \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty}M_n does not converge. 6.4.3. (a) Show that g(x) = \\sum_{n = 0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\cos (2^nx)}{2^n} is continuous on all of \\mathbf{R} . Proof : Given any [-M, M] , apply Theorem 6.4.4 (Cauchy Criterion for Uniform Convergence of Series), \\left| g_{m+1} + \\cdots + g_{n} \\right| \\leq \\frac{1}{2^{m+1}} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{2^n} \\\\ < \\frac{1}{2^m} \\square (b) The function g was cited in Section 5.4 as an example of a continuous nowhere di\ufb00erentiable function. What happens if we try to use Theorem 6.4.3 to explore whether g is di\ufb00erentiable? Solution : Let h_n(x) = g_n'(x) = - \\sin (2^n x). We can see \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty} h_n(x) is not uniformly converging. Because |h_n(1/2^{n+1}\\pi)| = \\sin (\\pi / 2) = 1 . Then apply Theorem 6.4.4 (Cauchy Criterion for Uniform Convergence of Series), we prove this. So we cannot use Theorem 6.4.3 to explore whether g is di\ufb00erentiable. \\square 6.4.4. Define g(x) = \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^{2n}}{1 + x^{2n}} Find the values of x where the series converges and show that we get a continuous function on this set. Solution : Let g_n(x) = \\frac{x^{2n}}{1 + x^{2n}} When |x| \\geq 1 , g_n(x) \\geq \\frac{1}{2} , so g(x) does not converge. When |x| < 1 , g_n(x) < x^{2n} . Then given x , \\left| g_{m+1} + \\cdots + g_{n} \\right| < \\\\ x^{2(m+1)} + x^{2n} = \\\\ \\frac{x^{2(m+1)} - x^{2(n+1)}}{1 - x^2} < \\\\ \\frac{x^{2(m+1)}}{1 - x^2} \\rightarrow 0 For any |x| < 1 , we can get |x| < M < 1 . Then we have \\frac{x^{2(m+1)}}{1 - x^2} \\leq \\frac{M^{2(m+1)}}{1-M^2} So g(x) converges uniformly on [-M, M] . g(x) is continuous at x . \\square 6.4.5. (a) Prove that h(x) = \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^n}{n^2} is continuous on [-1, 1] . Proof : \\left| \\frac{x^n}{n^2} \\right| \\leq \\frac{1}{n^2} and \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^2} converges. So based on Corollary 6.4.5 (Weierstrass M-Test), h(x) converges uniformly. So h(x) is continuous. \\square (b) The series h(x) = \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^n}{n} converges for every x in the half-open interval [\u22121,1) but does not converge when x = 1 . For a fixed x_0 \u2208 (\u22121,1) , explain how we can still use the Weierstrass M-Test to prove that f is continuous at x_0 . Proof : Given x_0 \\in (-1, 1) , we can find 0 < M < 1 such that x_0 \\in [-M, M] , we prove h(x) converges uniformly on this interval. |h_n(x)| = |\\frac{x^n}{n}| \\leq |x|^n \\leq M^n And \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty} M^n = \\frac{M}{1 - M} . So h(x) converges uniformly on [-M, M] . Then h(x) is continuous at x_0 . 6.4.6. Let f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} - \\frac{1}{x + 1} + \\frac{1}{x + 2} - \\frac{1}{x + 3} + \\frac{1}{x + 4} - \\cdots Show f is defined for all x > 0 . Is f continuous on (0, +\\infty) ? How about di\ufb00erentiable? Proof : Let f_1(x) = \\frac{1}{x} - \\frac{1}{x + 1} \\\\ f_2(x) = \\frac{1}{x + 2} - \\frac{1}{x + 3} \\\\ f_3(x) = \\frac{1}{x + 4} - \\frac{1}{x + 5} \\\\ \\cdots \\\\ f_n(x) = \\frac{1}{x + 2n - 2} - \\frac{1}{x + 2n - 1} \\\\ \\cdots \\\\ Given x , \\sum_{i = 0}^{n} f_i(x) is increasing, and we have \\sum_{i = 0}^{n} f_i(x) < \\sum_{i = 0}^{n} \\frac{1}{x + i - 1} - \\frac{1}{x + i}\\\\ < \\frac{1}{x} - \\frac{1}{x + n} < \\frac{1}{x} So it's upper bounded. So f(x) converges. Then let's check |f_{m+1}(x) + \\cdots + f_n(x)| \\\\ = \\sum_{i = m+1}^{n}\\frac{1}{x + 2i - 2} - \\frac{1}{x + 2i - 1} \\\\ < \\sum_{i = m+1}^{n} \\frac{1}{x + i - 1} - \\frac{1}{x + i} \\\\ = \\frac{1}{x + m} - \\frac{1}{x + n} < \\frac{1}{m} That means \\sum_{n = 0}^{\\infty} f_n(x) converges uniformly from Theorem 6.4.4. So f(x) is continuous. Now, let's examine the if it's differentiable. f_n'(x) = \\frac{1}{(x+2n-1)^2} - \\frac{1}{(x + 2n - 2)^2} Then we have |\\sum_{i = m+1}^{n} f_i'(x)| \\\\ = \\left| \\sum_{i = m+1}^{n} \\frac{1}{(x+2i-2)^2} - \\frac{1}{(x + 2i - 1)^2} \\right| \\\\ < \\left| \\sum_{i = m+1}^{n} \\frac{1}{(x+2i-2)^2} + \\frac{1}{(x + 2i - 1)^2} \\right| \\\\ < \\left| \\sum_{i = m+1}^{n} \\frac{1}{x + 2i - 2} - \\frac{1}{x + 2i} \\right| \\\\ = \\left| \\frac{1}{x + 2m} - \\frac{1}{x + 2n} \\right| \\\\ < \\frac{1}{2m} That means \\sum_{n = 0}^{\\infty} f_n'(x) converges uniformly from Theorem 6.4.4. So f(x) is differentiable. \\square 6.4.7. Let f(x) = \\sum_{k = 1}^{\\infty } \\frac{\\sin (kx)}{k^3} Anwser: (a) Show that f(x) is di\ufb00erentiable and that the derivative f'(x) is continuous. Proof : We have f_k(x) = \\frac{\\sin (kx)}{k^3} \\\\ f_k'(x) = \\frac{\\cos (kx)}{k^2} Then we have |f_k'(x)| \\leq \\frac{1}{k^2} , and \\sum_{k = 1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{k^2} converges. So based on Corollary 6.4.5, \\sum_{k = 1}^{\\infty} f_k'(x) \\rightarrow g(x) converges uniformly. That means f is differentiable, and f'(x) = g(x) . Each \\sum_{k = 1}^{n} f_k'(x) is continuous, so g(x) is also continuous. \\square (b) Can we determine if f is twice-di\ufb00erentiable? Solution : Consdier g_k(x) = -f_k''(x) = \\frac{\\sin (kx)}{k} Consider x = \\pi / 2 \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sin (n \\frac{pi}{2})}{n} \\\\ = 1 - \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{7} + \\cdots I cannot evne figure out if \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty} g_k(x) converges. \\square 6.4.8. Consider the function f(x) = \\sum_{k = 1}^{\\infty } \\frac{\\sin (x/k)}{k} Where is f defined? Continuous? Di\ufb00erentiable? Twice-di\ufb00erentiable? Solution : We will need this fact: \\sin x \\leq x for x \\geq 0 . Let g(x) = x - \\sin x , g'(x) = 1 - \\cos x \\geq 0 . Therefore, g(x) - g(0) = g(x) = g'(c)x \\geq 0 . So x \\geq \\sin x . Let f_n(x) = \\frac{\\sin (x/k)}{k} . Given x , consider |f_{m+1}(x) + \\cdots + f_n(x)| \\leq \\\\ |f_{m+1}(x)| + \\cdots + |f_n(x)| \\leq \\\\ \\frac{|x|}{(m+1)^2} + \\cdots \\frac{|x|}{n^2} < \\\\ \\frac{|x|}{m} - \\frac{|x|}{n} < \\frac{|x|}{m} So \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty}f_n(x) converges for all x \\in \\mathbf{R} . So f(x) is defined for x \\in \\mathbf{R} . Let g_n(x) = f_n'(x) = \\frac{\\cos (x/n)}{n^2} \\\\ Then we have |g_{m+1}(x) + \\cdots + g_n(x)| \\leq \\\\ |g_{m+1}(x)| + \\cdots + |g_n(x)| \\leq \\\\ \\frac{1}{(m+1)^2} + \\cdots \\frac{1}{n^2} < \\\\ \\frac{1}{m} - \\frac{1}{n} < \\frac{1}{m} That means \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty} g_n(x) \\rightarrow g(x) uniformly. We also know \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty}f_n(x) converges for all x \\in \\mathbf{R} . Then f is differentiable, and f' = g . Since it's differentiable, it has to be continuous. Let h_n(x) = g_n'(x) = -\\frac{\\sin (x/n)}{n^3} Since |h_n(x)| < \\frac{1}{n^2} and \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n^2} converges, then \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty}h_n(x) converges uniformly. Also since \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty}g_n(0) converges, then we know g(x) is differentiable and g'(x) = h(x) . So f is Twice-di\ufb00erentiable everywhere. \\square 6.4.9. Let h(x) = \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x^2 + n^2} Answer: (a) Show that h is a continuous function defined on all of \\mathbf{R} . Proof : let h_n(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2 + n^2} Then h_n(x) is continuous. Also h_n(x) \\leq \\frac{1}{n^2} , and we know \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^2} converges. So h converges uniformly on \\mathbf{R} . Based on Theorem 6.4.2, h is continuous on \\mathbf{R} . \\square (b) Is h di\ufb00erentiable? If so, is the derivative function h' continuous? Proof : Let g_n(x) = -h_n'(x) = \\frac{2x}{(x^2 + n^2)^2} If we plot the g_n(x) , we can see g_n(x) reaches its maximum value some where. We want to find this maximum value. So we get derivative of g_n(x) . g_n'(x) = \\frac{2(x^2 + n^2)^2 - 2x2(x^2+n^2)2x}{(x^2 + n^2)^2}\\\\ = \\frac{(2x^4 + 4x^2n^2+2n^4) - (8x^4+8x^2n^2)}{(x^2 + n^2)^2}\\\\ = \\frac{-6x^4 - 4x^2n^2 + 2n^4}{(x^2 + n^2)^2} If we set g_n'(x) = 0 , we have x^2 = \\frac{1}{3}n^2 .

Proof : Let g_n(x) = -h_n'(x) = \\frac{2x}{(x^2 + n^2)^2} If we plot the g_n(x) , we can see g_n(x) reaches its maximum value some where. We want to find this maximum value. So we get derivative of g_n(x) . g_n'(x) = \\frac{2(x^2 + n^2)^2 - 2x2(x^2+n^2)2x}{(x^2 + n^2)^2}\\\\ = \\frac{(2x^4 + 4x^2n^2+2n^4) - (8x^4+8x^2n^2)}{(x^2 + n^2)^2}\\\\ = \\frac{-6x^4 - 4x^2n^2 + 2n^4}{(x^2 + n^2)^2} If we set g_n'(x) = 0 , we have x^2 = \\frac{1}{3}n^2 . And then \\sup g_n(x) = g_n(\\sqrt[]{1/3}n) \\\\ = \\frac{\\frac{2}{\\sqrt[]{3}}n}{\\frac{16}{9}n^4} < \\frac{1}{n^3} Then we can see \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty}g_n'(x) converges uniformly. So h is differentiable and since each g_n(x) is continuous, h' is continuous. \\square","title":"6.4.9."},{"location":"ch06ex/#6410","text":"Let \\{r_1,r_2,r_3,...\\} be an enumeration of the set of rational numbers.

Proof: First u_n(x) \\leq 1/2^n , based on Corollary 6.4.5 (Weierstrass M-Test), \\sum_{n = 1}^{\\infty}u_n(x) converges to h(x) uniformly. So h(x) is well-defined.
