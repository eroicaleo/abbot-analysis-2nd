Solution: Yes. To obtain \\epsilon = \\min \\left\\{ \\epsilon_1, \\cdots, \\epsilon_n \\right\\} > 0 . If there are infinite number of open sets, it's not guaranteed \\epsilon > 0 . So we might not be able to find V_{\\epsilon}(a) . \\square (b) Give an example of a countable collection of open sets \\left\\{ O_1,O_2,O_3, ... \\right\\} whose intersection \\cap_{n=1}^\\infty O_n is closed, not empty and not all of \\mathbb{R} . Solution: Consider O_n = ( -\\frac{1}{n}, \\frac{1}{n} ) , then \\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty}O_n = \\left\\{ 0 \\right\\} which is a non-empty closed set. \\square 3.3.2 Let A = \\left\\{ (-1)^n + \\frac{2}{n} : n = 1, 2, 3 \\right\\} \\text{and } B = \\left\\{ x \\in \\mathbb{Q}: 0 < x < 1 \\right\\} Answer the following questions for each set: (a) What are the limit points? (b) Is the set open? Closed? (c) Does the set contain any isolated points? (d) Find the closure of the set. Solution: The limit points of A are \\left\\{ -1, 1 \\right\\} . For B , it's [0, 1] . Both A and B are neither open nor closed. For A , -1 \\not\\in A . For B , 1 \\not\\in B . All points in A are isolated except 1 . B does not contain any isolated points. \\overline{A} = A \\cup \\left\\{ -1\\right\\} and \\overline{B} = [0, 1] . \\square 3.2.3 Decide whether the following sets are open, closed, or neither. If a set is not open, find a point in the set for which there is no \u03b5-neighborhood contained in the set. If a set is not closed, find a limit point that is not contained in the set. (a) Q. Neither. Every point. \\sqrt{2} . Also see here . (b) \\mathbb{N} Closed. Every point. (c) \\{x \\in R:x \\ne 0\\} \\ Open. 0 . (d) \\{1+1/4+1/9+\\cdots+1/n^2: n \\in N\\} . Neither. Everypoint. It's limit. (e) \\{1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + \\cdots + 1/n : n \\in N\\} . Closed. Everypoint. 3.2.4 Let A be nonempty and bounded above so that s = \\sup A exists. (a) Show that s \u2208 \\overline{A} . Proof: According to Lemma 1.3.8., s is a limited point of A . So s \u2208 \\overline{A} . (b) Can an open set contain its supremum? Proof: No. If V_{\\epsilon}(s) = (s - \\epsilon, s + \\epsilon) \\subset A . Then s < s + \\epsilon/2 \\in A . Then s is not the supremum. We got a contradiction. See also here . 3.2.5 A set F \\subset \\mathbb{R} is closed if and only if every Cauchy sequence contained in F has a limit that is also an element of F . Proof: \\Rightarrow Assume F \\subset \\mathbb{R} is closed, and \\left( a_n \\right) is a Cauchy sequence contained in F . Then according to Theorem 2.6.4 (Cauchy Criterion), \\left( a_n \\right) converges. Let x = \\lim a_n . If \\exists n, \\text{such that } a_n = x , then x \\in F . If x \\neq a_n, \\forall n , then according to Theorem 3.2.5, x is a limit point of F , so x \\in F . \\Leftarrow Assume every Cauchy sequence contained in F has a limit that is also an element of F and x is a limit point of F . According Theorem 3.2.5, we can find some sequence (a_n) contained in F satisfying a_n \\ne x for all n \\in \\mathbb{N} and x = \\lim a_n . Again according to Theorem 2.6.4, (a_n) is a Cauchy sequence, then x \\in F . \\square 3.2.6 Decide whether the following statements are true or false. Provide counterexamples for those that are false, and supply proofs for those that are true. (a) An open set that contains every rational number must necessarily be all of R. No. Consider \\mathbb{R} - \\{\\pi\\} . (b) The Nested Interval Property remains true if the term \u201cclosed interval\u201d is replaced by \u201cclosed set.\u201d False. Let I_n = [n, \\infty) , which is closed. Then \\cap I_n = \\emptyset . See discussion here . But if the \"closed set\" is bounded. Then assume a_n = \\inf I_n, b_n = \\sup I_n . Then we have a_n, b_n \\in I_n . Now let a = \\sup \\{a_n\\} , because a is a limit point of I_n . so a \\in I_n, \\forall n . (c) Every nonempty open set contains a rational number. True. \\mathbb{Q} is dense. (d) Every bounded infinite closed set contains a rational number. False. Consider A = \\{\\pi + (1/n) : n\\in \\mathbb{N} \\} \\cup \\pi . Also see here (e) The Cantor set is closed. True. By definition in section 3.1 C = \\cap_{n=0}^\\infty C_n Each C_n is the union of finite closed set so it is closed from Theorem 3.2.14. Then C is the intersection of them, so it is also closed. 3.2.7 Given A \u2286 R , let L be the set of all limit points of A . (a) Show that the set L is closed. Proof: Assume x is limit point of L, then for every V_{\\epsilon}(x) , we can find x' \\in L and x' \\in V_{\\epsilon}(x) . Then x' is a limit point of A , so we can find a \\in A , such that a \\in V_{\\epsilon}(x) . The x itself is a limited point of A . So x \\in L . So L is closed. (b) Argue that if x is a limit point of A \\cup L , then x is a limit point of A . Use this observation to furnish a proof for Theorem 3.2.12. Proof. If l \\in L and l \\in V_{\\epsilon}(x) , then we can find a \\in V_{\\epsilon'}(l) \\subset V_{\\epsilon}(x) . So l is a limit point of A . Then l \\in L \\subseteq A \\cup L . Then A \\cup L is closed. 3.2.8 Assume A is an open set and B is a closed set. Determine if the following sets are definitely open, definitely closed, both, or neither. (a) \\overline{A\u222aB} Definitely closed. (b) A - B= \\{x\u2208A:x \\notin B\\} Definitely open. Assume x \\in A - B , then x \\notin B , so x is not a limit point of B . Then we can find V_{\\epsilon_1}(x) \\cap B = \\emptyset . Since A is open, we can find V_{\\epsilon_2}(x) \\subset A . So we can find \\epsilon = \\min(\\epsilon_1, \\epsilon_2) such that V_{\\epsilon}(x) \\in A - B . (c) (A^c \u222a B)^c A^c is closed, then (A^c \u222a B) is closed. Then (A^c \u222a B)^c is open. (d) (A\u2229B)\u222a(A^c \u2229B) It's equal to B , so closed. (e) \\overline{A}^c \u2229 \\overline{A^c} We prove \\overline{A^c} \\supset \\overline{A}^c . Assume a \\in \\overline{A}^c , then a \\notin \\overline{A} so a \\notin A , then a \\in A^c \\subset \\overline{A^c} . So \\overline{A}^c \\subset \\overline{A^c} . Then \\overline{A}^c \u2229 \\overline{A^c} = \\overline{A^c} . Then it is definitely closed. 3.2.10 Only one of the following three descriptions can be realized. Provide an example that illustrates the viable description, and explain why the other two cannot exist. (i) A countable set contained in [0, 1] with no limit points. This is not possible because of Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem. (ii) A countable set contained in [0, 1] with no isolated points. This is possible for \\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0, 1] . (iii) A set with an uncountable number of isolated points. Proof: This is impossible. Assume A is such set, x is an isolated points, such that V_{\\epsilon}(x) \\cap A =\\{x\\} . We will show we can find V_{\\epsilon_1}(x) does not intersect with any V_{\\epsilon_y}(y) . Assume V_{\\epsilon}(x) \\cap V_{\\epsilon_y}(y) \\ne \\emptyset and y > x . First we will show V_{\\epsilon}(x) \\cap V_{\\epsilon_z}(z) = \\emptyset, \\forall z > x . If this is not the case, and y > z , then z \\in V_{\\epsilon_y}(y) or z \\in V_{\\epsilon}(x) . This is not possible. If z > y , then y \\in V_{\\epsilon_z}(z) . This is also not possible. The same argument holds for y < x . So we can shrink V_{\\epsilon}(x) small enough. And this can be performed for any x \\in A . That means we have an uncountable set of open set and any two of them does not intersect with each other. But that means we can have uncountable many rational numbers. We have a contradiction. \\square Also search this question in stack overflow, like here 3.2.11 (a) Prove that \\overline{A \u222a B} = \\overline{A} \u222a \\overline{B} . Proof: We first prove \\overline{A \u222a B} \\subset \\overline{A} \u222a \\overline{B} . A \\subset \\overline{A} \u222a \\overline{B} and B \\subset \\overline{A} \u222a \\overline{B} , so A \u222a B \\subset \\overline{A} \u222a \\overline{B} . Because \\overline{A} \u222a \\overline{B} is also a closed set, it must contain the closure of A \u222a B according to Theorem 3.2.12. So \\overline{A \u222a B} \\subset \\overline{A} \u222a \\overline{B} . On the other hand, A \\subset \\overline{A \u222a B} so \\overline{A} \\subset \\overline{A \u222a B} . For the same reason, \\overline{B} \\subset \\overline{A \u222a B} . So \\overline{A} \u222a \\overline{B} \\subset \\overline{A \u222a B} . So we have \\overline{A \u222a B} = \\overline{A} \u222a \\overline{B} . \\square (b) Does this result about closures extend to infinite unions of sets? Proof: No. Consider A_1 = [1/2, 1], ..., A_n = [1/(n+1), 1/n] . Then \\cup \\overline{A_n} = (0, 1] . However \\cup A_n = (0, 1] , so \\overline{\\cup A_n} = [0, 1] . 3.2.12 Let A be an uncountable set and let B be the set of real numbers that divides A into two uncountable sets; that is, s \u2208 B if both \\{x : x\u2208A \\text{ and } x<s\\} and \\{x:x\u2208A \\text{ and } x>s\\} are uncountable. Show B is nonempty and open. Proof: Define C_s = (-\\infty, s] and C = \\left\\{ s : A \\cap C_s \\text{ is countable} \\right\\} . We can see C \\ne \\mathbb{R} . Otherwise, A = \\cup_{i = 1}^{\\infty} (A \\cap C_i) is countable. This means C is upper bounded. Let c = \\sup C , we will show c \\in C . A \\cap C_c = \\cup_{i = 1}^{\\infty} (A \\cap C_{c-\\frac{1}{i}}) \\cup (A \\cap \\left\\{ c \\right\\} ) is countable. So c \\in C . Furthurmore C = (-\\infty, c] . Similarly, define D_s = [s, \\infty) and D = \\left\\{ s : A \\cap D_s \\text{ is countable} \\right\\} . We can show D = [d, \\infty) for some d . Furthur more C \\cap D = \\emptyset . Otherwise A is countable. So finally, we have B = (c, d) is nonempty and open. 3.2.13 Prove that the only sets that are both open and closed are \\mathbb{R} and the empty set \\emptyset . Proof: Consider a \\in A \\ne \\emptyset and b \\in A^c \\ne \\emptyset . WLOG, assume a < b . Let A' = A \\cap [a, b] . Since the intersection of 2 closed sets are closed, A' is closed. Let s = \\sup A' . since A' is closed, s \\in A' (Exercise 3.2.4). b is an upper bound of A' , so s \\leq b . If s = b , then s \\in A^c . We have a contradiction. If s < b , since A is open, there exists V_{\\epsilon}(s) \\subset A \\cap [a, b] = A' , then s is not a superem of A' . We have another contradiction. \\square Also see stackexchange here . 3.2.14 A dual notion to the closure of a set is the interior of a set. The interior of E is denoted E^o and is defined as E^o = \\{x \\in E: \\text{there exists } V_{\\epsilon}(x)\u2286E \\}. a. Show that E is closed if and only if E=\\overline{E} . Show that E is open if and only if E^o = E . Proof: E is closed so it contains all its limited points, i.e. L \\subset E , so E \\supset E \\cup L = \\overline{E} . On the other hand, E \\subset \\overline{E} . So E = \\overline{E} . E is open, so if x \\in E then there exists V_{\\epsilon}(x) \\subseteq E . so x \\in E^o , and E \\subseteq E^o . On the other hand, E \\supseteq E^o . So E = E^o . \\square b. Show that \\overline{E}^c = (E^c)^o , and similarly that (E^o)^c = \\overline{E^c} . Proof: First statement. Assume x \\in \\overline{E}^c , then x \\notin \\overline{E} . Then x \\notin E , so x \\in E^c . Furthermore x is not a limit point of E , so there exists V_{\\epsilon}(x)\u2286 E^c . Then x \\in (E^c)^o . On the other hand if x \\in (E^c)^o , then there exists V_{\\epsilon}(x)\u2286 E^c . So x \\notin \\overline{E} , so x \\in \\overline{E}^c . Second statement. Assume x \\in (E^o)^c , then x \\notin E^o . Then x is a limit point of E^c , so x \\in \\overline{E^c} . On the other hand, assume x \\in \\overline{E^c} . If x \\in E^c , then x \\in (E^o)^c . If x \\notin E^c , x is a limit point of E^c . So there doesn't exist V_{\\epsilon}(x)\u2286 E , then x \\notin E^o . So x \\in (E^o)^c . \\square 3.2.15 A set A is called an F_\u03c3 set if it can be written as the countable union of closed sets. A set B is called a G_\u03b4 set if it can be written as the countable intersection of open sets. (a) Show that a closed interval [a, b] is a G_\u03b4 set. Proof: Let A_n = (a - 1/n, b + 1/n) . Then [a,b] = \\cap_{i = 1}^{\\infty} A_n . (b) Show that the half-open interval (a, b] is both a G_\u03b4 and an F_\u03c3 set. Proof: Let A_n = [a+\\frac{1}{n}, b] , then (a, b] is F_\u03c3 . Let B_n = (a, b+\\frac{1}{n}) , then (a, b] is G_\u03b4 . (c) Show that Q is an F_\u03c3 set, and the set of irrationals I forms a G_\u03b4 set. Proof: Let A_q = \\{q\\} . Then it's a closed set. Since Q is countable, the union of them is Q . Let B_q = R - \\{q\\} , then B_q is open. The intersection of them is I . \\square 3.3 Compact Sets 3.3.1 Show that if K is compact and nonempty, then \\sup K and \\inf K both exist and are elements of K . Proof: Since K is compact, then it's bounded and closed. So \\sup K and \\inf K both exist. Because it's closed. According to Exercise 3.2.4., \\sup K \\in S, \\inf K \\in S . 3.3.2 Decide which of the following sets are compact. For those that are not compact, show how Definition 3.3.1 breaks down. In other words, give an example of a sequence contained in the given set that does not possess a subsequence converging to a limit in the set. (a) N. Not compact. Itself. (b) Q \\cap [0,1] Not compact. A sequence converges to \\sqrt{2}/2 . (c) The Cantor set. Compact. Close and bounded. (d) \\{1+1/2^2 +1/3^2 +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+1/n^2 :n\u2208N\\} . Not closed. Itself. (e) \\{1,1/2,2/3,3/4,4/5,...\\}. Compact. Closed and bounded. It has 1 limit point which is 1, so it's closed. 3.3.3 Prove the converse of Theorem 3.3.4 by showing that if a set K \u2286 R is closed and bounded, then it is compact. Proof: If K is closed and bounded. And (a_n) is a sequence in K . Then since (a_n) is bounded, according to Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass Theorem, there is a subsequence a_{n_k} \\rightarrow x . Then x is a limit point of K , then x \\in K . 3.3.4 Assume K is compact and F is closed. Decide if the following sets are definitely compact, definitely closed, both, or neither. (a) K \\cap F Proof: It's compact. K is bounded, so K \\cap F is also bounded. And it's also closed. So it's compact. (b) \\overline{F^c \\cup K^c} Proof: It's closed not compact. F^c is unbounded. (c) \\left\\{ K \\backslash F = { x \u2208 K : x \\notin F } \\right\\} Proof: It can be neither, e.g. let K = [-1, 1] and F = [0, \\infty] . (d) \\overline{K \\cap F^c} Proof: It's compact. K \\cap F^c \\subseteq K , so \\overline{K \\cap F^c} \\subseteq K . So it's bounded closed set. 3.3.5 Decide whether the following propositions are true or false. If the claim is valid, supply a short proof, and if the claim is false, provide a counterexample. (a) The arbitrary intersection of compact sets is compact. Proof: True. compact set is closed and bounded. The arbitrary intersection of closed set is closed. The arbitrary intersection of bounded set is bounded. So it's closed and bounded. As long as it's not empty, then it's compact. (b) The arbitrary union of compact sets is compact. Proof: False. counterexample. Let A_n = [n, n+1] . (c) Let A be arbitrary, and let K be compact. Then, the intersection A \u2229 K is compact. Proof: False. Let A = (0, 1), K = [0, 1] . (d) If F1 \u2287 F2 \u2287 F3 \u2287 F4 \u2287 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 is a nested sequence of nonempty closed sets, then the intersection \\cap_{n=1}^{\\infty} F_n \\not= \\emptyset . Proof: False. Let F_n = [n, \\infty) . 3.3.6 This exercise is meant to illustrate the point made in the opening paragraph to Section 3.3. Verify that the following three statements are true if every blank is filled in with the word \u201cfinite.\u201d Which are true if every blank is filled in with the word \u201ccompact\u201d? Which are true if every blank is filled in with the word \u201cclosed\u201d? (a) Every finite set has a maximum. True. Every compact set has a maximum. True. Bounded and closed. Exercise 3.2.4. Every closed set has a maximum. False. [0, \\infty) . (b) If A and B are finite, then A+B={a+b:a\u2208A,b\u2208B} is also finite. True. If A and B are compact, then A+B={a+b:a\u2208A,b\u2208B} is also compact. True. proof: Assume c is a limit point of A+B , we can find a sequence \\{a_n + b_n\\} \\rightarrow c . For \\{a_n\\} , since A is compact, we can find a subsequence \\{a_{n_k}\\} \\rightarrow a \\in A . Again \\{a_{n_k} + b_{n_k}\\} \\rightarrow c . We can find a subsequence b_{n_{k_l}} \\rightarrow b . So a_{n_{k_l}} + b_{n_{k_l}} \\rightarrow c and a_{n_{k_l}} + b_{n_{k_l}} \\rightarrow a + b . So c = a + b . So c \\in A+B . See also here If A and B are closed, then A+B={a+b:a\u2208A,b\u2208B} is also closed. False. Consdier A = \\{n + \\frac{1}{10^n}: n = 1, 2, \\cdots\\} \\\\ B = \\{-n : n = 1, 2, \\cdots\\} Both sets are closed. And 0 is a limit point of A+B . And 0 \\notin A+B . See also here . (c) If \\{A_n: n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} is a collection of finite sets with the property that every finite subcollection has a nonempty intersection, the \\cap A_n \\ne \\emptyset . Proof: This is true. Assume otherwise. Consider B_n = \\cap_{i=1}^n A_n Consider a_1 \\in A_1 = B_1 , since a_1 \\notin \\cap A_n = \\cap B_n , we can find N_1 , such that a \\notin B_n, \\forall n > N_1 . We can check for all elements in a_i \\in A_1 and find N_{i} for each a_i . Then we choose N = \\max \\left\\{ N_1, N_2, \\dots \\right\\} . Then for any n > N, a_i \\not\\in B_n . B_n is empty. This contradicts to every finite subcollection has a nonempty intersection. So this statement is true. \\square If \\{A_n: n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} is a collection of compact sets with the property that every finite subcollection has a nonempty intersection, the \\cap A_n \\ne \\emptyset . Proof: This is true. Again consider B_n = \\cap_{i=1}^n A_n Then we have B_1 \\supseteq B_2 \\supseteq \\dots They are all compact. So from Theorem 3.3.5 (Nested Compact Set Property), A is not empty. If \\{A_n: n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} is a collection of closed sets with the property that every finite subcollection has a nonempty intersection, then \\cap A_n \\ne \\emptyset . Proof: False. Consider A_n = [n, \\infty) . 3.3.7 As some more evidence of the surprising nature of the Cantor set, follow these steps to show that the sum C +C = \\{x+y : x,y \u2208 C\\} is equal to the closed interval [0, 2] . (Keep in mind that C has zero length and contains no intervals.) Because C \u2286 [0,1], C + C \u2286 [0,2] , so we only need to prove the reverse inclusion [0,2] \u2286 \\{x + y : x,y \u2208 C\\} . Thus, given s \u2208 [0,2] , we must find two elements x,y\u2208C satisfying x+y=s . (a) Show that there exist x_1 , y_1 \u2208 C1 for which x_1 + y_1 = s . Show in general that, for an arbitrary n \u2208 N , we can always find x_n,y_n \u2208 C_n for which x_n + y_n = s . Proof: Let's start with C_0 = [0, 1] . Given any s in [0,2] , choose any x_0, y_0 such that s = x_0 + y_0 . So how do we find x_1, y_1 \\in C_1 such that s = x_1 + y_1 ? We distinguish the following cases: If both x_0, y_0 are in [0, 1/3] or [2/3, 1] then let x_1 = x_0 \\in C_1 and y_1 = y_0 \\in C_1 . If none of x_0, y_0 are in [0, 1/3] or [2/3, 1] , then it means x_0, y_0 \\in (1/3, 2/3) . Then lets x_1 = x_0 - 1/3 \\in [0, 1/3] \\subset C_1 and y_1 = y_0 + 1/3 \\in [2/3, 1] \\subset C_1 . If x_0 \\in [0, 1/3] and y_0 \\in (1/3, 2/3) . Then let c_l = x_0 - 0, c_r = 1/3 - x_0 and d_l = y_0 - 1/3, d_r = 2/3 - y_0 . if c_l \\geq d_r , then let x_1 = x_0 - d_r \\in [0, 1/3] , y_1 = y_0 + d_r = 2/3 \\in [2/3, 1] , then x_1, y_1 \\in C_1 . if c_l < d_r , then c_r >= d_l . Then let x_1 = x_0 + d_l \\in [0, 1/3] and y_1 = y_0 - d_r = 1/3 \\in [0, 1/3] . So x_1, y_1 \\in C_1 . Similar argument can be applied when x_0 \\in [2/3, 1] and y_0 \\in (1/3, 2/3) . In conclusion, we proved we can find there exist x_1 , y_1 \u2208 C1 for which x_1 + y_1 = s . Use induction and the similar argument, we can show for an arbitrary n \u2208 N , we can always find x_n,y_n \u2208 C_n for which x_n + y_n = s . \\square (b) Keeping in mind that the sequences (x_n) and (y_n) do not necessarily converge, show how they can nevertheless be used to produce the desired x and y in C satisfying x + y = s . Proof: Assume x_n \\in C_n and x_n \\in I_n . |I_n| = 1/3^n . Using the method in (a) to find x_{n+1} , we know x_{n+1} \\in I_n , and it's either in the left 1/3 or in the right 1/3 part of I_n , call it I_{n+1} . Then we produce I_1 \\supset I_2 \\supset \\dots , such that x_n \\in I_n . According to NIP, there exists x in all of them, that's (x_n) converge to. Next, we prove x \\in C . Because x_1, x_2, \\dots \\in I_1 which is closed, so x \\in I_1 . For the same reason, x \\in I_n \\subset C_n, \\forall n . So x \\in C . Simiarly, we can find the y we need. Finally, we also have x + y = \\lim x_n + \\lim y_n = \\lim (x_n + y_n) = s . \\square See also the stackoverflow discussion . 3.3.8 Let K and L be nonempty compact sets, and define d = \\inf \\{ |x \u2212 y| : x \u2208 K \\text{ and } y \u2208 L \\}. This turns out to be a reasonable definition for the distance between K and L . (a) If K and L are disjoint,show d>0 and that d=|x_0\u2212y_0| for some x_0 \u2208K and y_0 \u2208 L . Proof: Consider sequence x_n - y_n \\rightarrow d , since K and L are compact, we can find subsequence \\{x_{n_k}\\} \\rightarrow x , from there we can find another subsequence \\{y_{n_{k_{l}} }\\} \\rightarrow y , then x - y = d . Since x \\in X and y \\in Y , then x - y \\ne 0 . (b) Show that it\u2019s possible to have d = 0 if we assume only that the disjoint sets K and L are closed. Consider K = \\{1-\\frac{1}{10}, 2-\\frac{1}{100},\\dots\\} \\\\ L = \\{1, 2, \\dots\\} Then the distance can be 0. See also two stackexchange discussions: Q&A 1 Q&A 2 3.3.9 Follow these steps to prove the final implication in Theorem 3.3.8. Assume K satisfies (i) and (ii), and let \\left\\{ O_{\\lambda}(x) : \\lambda \\in \\Lambda \\right\\} be an open cover for K . For contradiction, let\u2019s assume that no finite subcover exists. Let I_0 be a closed interval containing K . (a) Show that there exists a nested sequence of closed intervals I_0 \\supseteq I_1 \\supseteq I_2 \\cdots with the property that, for each n , I_n \\cap K cannot be finitely covered and \\lim |I_0| = 0 . Proof: Because I_0 \\cap K = K , so I_0 \\cap K cannot be finitely covered. Let I_0 = [a_0, b_0] . Now consider [a_0, (a_0+b_0)/2] and [(a_0+b_0)/2, b_0] . One of them intersecting with K must not be finitely covered. So we found I_1 . We can continue this process to find I_n . They satisfy the property. \\square (b) Argue that there exists an x \u2208 K such that x \u2208 I_n for all n . Proof: I_n \\cap K is non empty since it cannot be finitely covered. It is also closed set since both I_0 and K are closed. Then based on Theorem 3.3.5 (Nested Compact Set Property), the intersection is non-empty. \\square (c) Because x \u2208 K , there must exist an open set O_{\\lambda_0} from the original collection that contains x as an element. Explain how this leads to the desired contradiction. Proof: Since O_{\\lambda_0} covers x , we can find V_{\\epsilon}(x) \\subset O_{\\lambda_0} . Then as long as |I_n| < \\epsilon/2 , I_n is covered by V_{\\epsilon}(x) \\subset O_{\\lambda_0} . However, I_n cannot be finitely covered. We have a contradiction. \\square 3.3.10 Here is an alternate proof to the one given in Exercise 3.3.9 for the final implication in the Heine\u2013Borel Theorem. Consider the special case where K is a closed interval. Let \\{O_\u03bb : \u03bb \u2208 \u039b\\} be an open cover for [a,b] and define S to be the set of all x \u2208 [a,b] such that [a,x] has a finite subcover from \\{O_\u03bb : \u03bb \u2208 \u039b\\} . (a) Argue that S is nonempty and bounded, and thus s = \\sup S exists. Proof. Consider a is cover by O_a , then we can find V_{\\epsilon}(a) \\subset O_a , then [a, a+\\epsilon/2] \\subset V_{\\epsilon}(a) . So S is nonempty. Furthermore, we will prove s \\in S . Assume O_s covers s . Then we can find V_{\\epsilon}(s) \\subset O_s , the [s, s-\\epsilon/2] \\subset V_{\\epsilon}(s) . And [a, s-\\epsilon/2] has a finite subcover. So [a, s] has a finite subcover. \\square (b) Now show s = b , which implies [a, b] has a finite subcover. Proof. Assume s = c < b . Then c is covered by O_c . Since O_c is open, then we can find c < c' \\in O_c , then [a, c'] has a finite subcover. We have a contradiction. \\square (c) Finally, prove the theorem for an arbitrary closed and bounded set K . Proof. Since K is bounded, then we can assume K \\subseteq [a,b] . Assume O_\\lambda is an open cover of K . And assume c \\notin K, c \\in [a,b] . Since K is closed, we know c is not a limit point of K . Then we can find V_{\\epsilon}(c) \\cap K = \\emptyset . This way, we can construct an open cover of [a, b] , i.e O_\\lambda \\cup V_{\\epsilon}(c) . Then we can find a finite cover. From that finite cover, we can find a sub finite cover which is in O_\\lambda . \\square 3.3.11 Consider each of the sets listed in Exercise 3.3.2. For each one that is not compact, find an open cover for which there is no finite subcover. (a) N. (n-1/2, n+1/2) (b) Q \\cap [0,1] (q-\\epsilon/2, q+\\epsilon/2) where \\epsilon is distance between q and \\sqrt{2}/2 . (d) \\{1+1/2^2 +1/3^2 +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+1/n^2 :n\u2208N\\} . Let a_n = 1+1/2^2 +1/3^2 +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+1/n^2 and let O_n = (a-1/2(n+1)^2, a+ 1/2(n+1)^2) 3.3.12 Using the concept of open covers (and explicitly avoiding the Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass Theorem), prove that every bounded infinite set has a limit point. Proof: We use contradiction. Assume K is a bounded infinite set, and K \\subset [a, b] . Assume K has no limit point. Since none of the point in [a,b] is a limit point of K . Then for any x \\in [a,b] , we can find V_{\u03b5}(x) \\cap K = \\{x\\} . Then we can find a finite cover of [a,b] , which is also a finite cover of K . So K is finite. See also here 3.3.13 Let\u2019s call a set clompact if it has the property that every closed cover (i.e., a cover consisting of closed sets) admits a finite subcover. Describe all of the clompact subsets of R . Solution: all clompact are finite set. Because one point set \\{x\\} is a closed set. See also here 3.4 Perfect Sets and Connected Sets 3.4.1 If P is a perfect set and K is compact, is the intersection P \\cap K always compact? Always perfect? Proof: It's always compact. Bounded and closed. Let P = [0, 1] and K = \\left\\{ 0, 1 \\right\\} . 3.4.2 Does there exist a perfect set consisting of only rational numbers? Proof: No. This set must be countable, but a perfect set is uncountable. 3.4.3 Review the portion of the proof given in Example 3.4.2 and follow these steps to complete the argument. (a) Because x \u2208 C_1 , argue that there exists an x_1 \u2208 C \\cap C_1 with x_1 \\ne x satisfying |x \u2212 x_1| \u2264 1/3 . Proof: Let x_1 = 0, 1/3, 2/3, 1 . (b) Finish the proof by showing that for each n \u2208 N , there exists x_n \u2208 C \\cap C_n , different from x , satisfying |x \u2212 x_n| \u2264 1/3^n . Proof: pick either boundary. 3.4.4 Repeat the Cantor construction from Section 3.1 starting with the interval [0, 1] . This time, however, remove the open middle fourth from each component. (a) Is the resulting set compact? Perfect? Proof: It's compact. Since it's closed and bounded. It's also perfect we can follow the same argument as 3.4.3. 3.4.5 Let A and B be nonempty subsets of R. Show that if there exist disjoint open sets U and V with A\u2286U and B\u2286V ,then A and B are separated. Proof: Since V is open, V has no limit point of U , so \\overline{U} \\cap V = \\emptyset . Simiarly \\overline{V} \\cap U = \\emptyset . Then \\overline{A} \\cap B \\subseteq \\overline{V} \\cap U =\\emptyset and \\overline{B} \\cap A \\subseteq \\overline{U} \\cap V=\\emptyset . 3.4.6 Prove Theorem 3.4.6 Proof: * \\Rightarrow Assume E \u2286 R is connected and nonempty disjoint sets A and B satisfying E = A \u222a B . Assume there is no such sequence in both A and B . It means A has no limit points of B and B has no limit points of A . So A \\cap \\overline{B} = \\emptyset and B \\cap \\overline{A} = \\emptyset . Then E is not connected. * \\Leftarrow Assume for all nonempty disjoint sets A and B satisfying E = A \u222a B , there always exists a convergent sequence (x_n) \u2192 x with (x_n) contained in one of A or B , and x an element of the other. Then it means A \\cap \\overline{B} \\neq \\emptyset or B \\cap \\overline{A} \\neq \\emptyset . 3.4.7 A set E is totally disconnected if, given any two distinct points x,y \u2208 E , there exist separated sets A and B with x \u2208 A , y \u2208 B , and E = A\u222aB . (a) Show that Q is totally disconnected. Proof. Assume a, b \\in Q and a < b . Then we can find an irrational number r such that a < r < b , so let A = (-\\infty, r) \\cap Q and B = (r, \\infty) \\cap Q . (b) Is the set of irrational numbers totally disconnected? Proof. Yes. The same argument in (a) can also be applied here. See also stackoverflow . 3.4.8 Follow these steps to show that the Cantor set is totally disconnected in the sense described in Exercise 3.4.7. Let C = \\cap^\u221e_{n=0} C_n , as defined in Section 3.1. (a) Given x,y\u2208C ,with x<y , set \\epsilon = y\u2212x . For each n=0,1,2,..., the set C_n consists of a finite number of closed intervals. Explain why there must exist an N large enough so that it is impossible for x and y both to belong to the same closed interval of C_N . Proof. This is because the length of the internals C_n is 1/3^n . So we can find N large enough so 1/3^N < \\epsilon . (b) Show that C is totally disconnected. Proof. Since x,y\u2208C will not be in the same closed interval of C_N , and assume x < y , we can find z \\not\\in C_N such that x < z < y . Let A = (-\\infty, z) and B = (z, \\infty) . Using exercise 3.4.5, we know A \\cap C and B \\cap C are separated. So C is totally disconnected. 3.4.9 Let \\{r1, r2, r3, . . .\\} be an enumeration of the rational numbers, and for each n \\in N , set \\epsilon_n = 1/2^n . Define O = \\cup_{n=1}^\\infty V_{\\epsilon_n}(r_n) and let F = O^c . (a) Argue that F is a closed, nonempty set consisting only of irrational numbers. Proof: O is an union of open set, so it's open. Then F is closed. O contains all rational numbers, so F only contains irrational numbers. Now we need to prove F is not empty. Assume F is empty. Then consider [0, 1] and O is an open cover of it. Since it's compact, then we can find an finite sub cover of it. Then the total length of subcover is strictly less than 1 , then we must have some points not covered by this subcover. We got a contradiction. (b) Does F contain any nonempty open intervals? Is F totally disconnected? Proof. It's not possible. Because \\mathbb{Q} is dense. It's totally disconnected. (c) Is it possible to know whether F is perfect? If not, can we modify this construction to produce a nonempty perfect set of irrational numbers? Proof: I am inclined to think F is not perfect. But I cannot prove it for now. * I can prove F must have infinite elements for any given interval with length \\ge 2 . The way is pretty much the same as how we prove F is not empty. 3.5 Baire\u2019s Theorem 3.5.1 Argue that a set A is a G_\u03b4 set if and only if its complement is an F_\u03c3 set. Proof. Use De Morgan\u2019s Laws. 3.5.2 Replace each underscore with the word finite or countable, depending on which is more appropriate. (a) The finite/countable union of F_\u03c3 sets is an F_\u03c3 set. Both are correct. This is because countable union of countable sets is still countable union of sets. See also here . (b) The finite/countable intersection of F_\u03c3 sets is an F_\u03c3 set. Proof: First, countable intersection of F_\u03c3 sets might not be an F_\u03c3 set. Consider U_r = \\left\\{ x | x \\neq r \\right\\} where r is an rational number. Then U_r is F_\u03c3 set. But their intersection is I , which is all irrational numbers. As shown in Exercise 3.5.6, I cannot be F_\u03c3 set. Then finite intersection of F_\u03c3 sets might not be an F_\u03c3 set. Assume U = \\cup U_i and V = \\cup V_j . Then U \\cap V = \\cup U_i \\cap V_j . Since U_i \\cap V_j is closed. And there are countable of them, so U \\cap V is F_\u03c3 . (c) The finite/countable union of G_\u03b4 sets is a G_\u03b4 set. See (b) and De Morgan's law. (d) The finite/countable intersection of G_\u03b4 sets is a G_\u03b4 set. See (a) and De Morgan's law. 3.5.4 Prove Theorem 3.5.2. Proof: Since G_1 is open, we can find [a_1, b_1] \\subseteq G_1 . Since G_2 is dense, we can find [a_2, b_2] \\subseteq [a_1, b_1] and [a_2, b_2] \\subseteq G_2 . Then we construct a nested sequence of closed intervals I_1 \u2287 I_2 \u2287 I_3 \u2287\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 satisfying I_n \u2286 G_n . 3.5.5 Show that it is impossible to write R = \\cup_{n=1}^{\\infty} F_n where for each n \u2208 N , F_n is a closed set containing no nonempty open intervals. Proof: Consider G_n = (F_n)^c , so G_n is open, and it's also dense. Then from 3.5.4, the intersection of G_n is not empty. So the union of F_n cannot be the whole R . 3.5.6 Show how the previous exercise implies that the set I of irrationals cannot be an F_\u03c3 set, and Q cannot be a G_\u03b4 set. Proof: Assume I is an F_{\\sigma} set. I = \\cup_{n=1}^{\\infty} F_n F_n is a closed set containing no nonempty open intervals. And Q can be written as Q = \\cup_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\{q_n | q_n \\in Q\\} Q_n is a closed set containing no nonempty open intervals. And R = I \\cup Q . We have a contradiction. 3.5.7 Using Exercise 3.5.6 and versions of the statements in Exercise 3.5.2, construct a set that is neither in F_\u03c3 nor in G_\u03b4 . Solution: Let A = \\left\\{ x | x \\in [-1, 0] \\cap \\mathbf{I}\\right\\} and B = \\left\\{ x | x \\in [0, 1] \\cap \\mathbf{Q}\\right\\} . Let C = A \\cup B . Assume C is F_\u03c3 . We have C \\cap [-1, 0] = (A \\cup B) \\cap [-1, 0] = (A \\cap [-1, 0]) \\cup (B \\cap [-1, 0]) = A \\cup \\emptyset = A . So A is F_\u03c3 . But then \\mathbf{I} will be F_\u03c3 . We have a contradiction. Assume C is G_\u03b4 . C \\cap [0, 1] = (A \\cup B) \\cap [0, 1] = (A \\cap [0, 1]) \\cup (B \\cap [0, 1]) = \\emptyset \\cup B = B . We want to show B is not G_\u03b4 set. Assume otherwise. Consider B^c = (-\\infty, 0) \\cup ([0, 1] \\cap \\mathbf{I}) \\cup (1, \\infty) , which has to be F_\u03c3 . Then ([0, 1] \\cap \\mathbf{I}) has to be F_\u03c3 , which is impossible. So C is neither in F_\u03c3 nor in G_\u03b4 . 3.5.8 Show that a set E is nowhere-dense in \\mathbb{R} if and only if the complement of \\overline{E} is dense in R. Proof. \\Leftarrow Assume the complement of \\overline{E} is dense in \\mathbb{R} , also assume (a, b) \\subset \\overline{E} . Further assume a < c < b . Since (a, b) \\cap \\overline{E}^c = \\emptyset . c cannot be a limit point of \\overline{E}^c , so \\overline{\\overline{E}^c} \\ne \\mathbb{R} , so it's not dense, we have a contradiction. \\Rightarrow Conversely, assume E is nowhere-dense in \\mathbb{R} and a \\in \\overline{E} , because \\overline{E} does not contain open interval, in every V_{\\epsilon}(a) , we can find b \\in \\overline{E}^c , it means a is a limit point of \\overline{E}^c . So \\overline{\\overline{E}^c} = \\mathbb{R} . So the complement of \\overline{E} is dense in \\mathbb{R} . 3.5.9 Decide whether the following sets are dense in \\mathbb{R} , nowhere-dense in \\mathbb{R} , or somewhere in between. (a) A=Q\u2229[0,5] . Some where is between. Apparently, \\overline{A} = [0,5] which contains open interval. So it's not nowhere-dense. But it's not \\mathbb{R} , so it's not dense. But it's dense in [0,5] . (b) B =\\{1/n:n\u2208N\\} . nowhere-dense. (c) the set of irrationals. dense, since it's closure is \\mathbb{R} (d) the Cantor set. nowhere-dense. Since itself is a closed set. And it does not contain open interval. See exercise 3.4.8. 3.5.10 Finish the proof by finding a contradiction to the results in this section. Proof. We consider \\cup^{\u221e}_{n=1} \\overline{E_n} , then diretly apply Exercise 3.5.5. We can prove it.

Theorem 3.2.8 A set F \u2286 R is closed if and only if every Cauchy sequence contained in F has a limit that is also an element of F . Proof: See exercise 3.2.5.

Definition 3.3.1 (Compactness). A set K \\subseteq R is compact if every sequence in K has a subsequence that converges to a limit that is also in K . Example 3.3.2. The most basic example of a compact set is a closed interval. What are the properties of closed intervals that we used in the preceding argument? The Bolzano\u2013Weierstrass Theorem requires boundedness and we used the fact that closed sets contain their limit points. Definition 3.3.3. A set A \u2286 R is bounded if there exists M > 0 such that |a|\u2264M for all a\u2208A . Theorem 3.3.4 (Characterization of Compactness in R). A set K \\subseteq R is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. Proof: \\Rightarrow 3.4 Perfect Sets and Connected Sets One of the underlying goals of topology is to strip away all of the extraneous information that comes with our intuitive picture of the real numbers and isolate just those properties that are responsible for the phenomenon we are studying. Definition 3.4.1. A set P \u2286 \\mathbb{R} is perfect if it is closed and contains no isolated points. Example 3.4.2 (Cantor Set). It is not too hard to see that the Cantor set is perfect. See exercise 3.4.3. Theorem 3.4.3. A nonempty perfect set is uncountable. Summary of proof: Assume P is countable, and P = \\{x_1, x_2, \\dots\\} . Let I_1 be an interval such that x_1 in the interior of I_1 . Since x_1 is not isolated, we can find y_2 in the interior of I_1 . Then we can construct I_2 such that y_2 is in the middle of I_2 and I_2 \\subset I_1 and x_1 \\notin I_2 . We can continue this process and they satisfy: I_{n+1} \\subseteq I_n x_n \\notin I_{n+1} x_{n-1} \\neq y_n\\in I_n \\cap P \\neq \\emptyset . And let K_n = I_n \\cap P . Then based on Nested Compact Set Property, \\cap K_n is not empty. However, since x_n \\notin K_{n+1} , \\cap K_n = \\emptyset . We got a contradiction. Connected Sets Definition 3.4.4. Two nonempty sets A, B \u2286 R are separated if \\overline{A} \u2229 B and A \u2229 \\overline{B} are both empty. A set E \u2286 R is disconnected if it can be written as E = A \u222a B , where A and B are nonempty separated sets. A set that is not disconnected is called a connected set. Example 3.4.5. the set of rational numbers is disconnected. Just need to consider A = (-\\infty, \\sqrt{2}) and B = (\\sqrt{2}, \\infty) . Theorem 3.4.6. A set E \u2286 R is connected if and only if, for all nonempty disjoint sets A and B satisfying E = A \u222a B , there always exists a convergent sequence (x_n) \u2192 x with (x_n) contained in one of A or B , and x an element of the other. Proof: \\Rightarrow Assume E \u2286 R is connected and nonempty disjoint sets A and B satisfying E = A \u222a B . Assume there is no such sequence in both A and B . It means A has no limit points of B and B has no limit points of A . So A \\cap \\overline{B} = \\emptyset and B \\cap \\overline{A} = \\emptyset . Then E is not connected. \\Leftarrow Assume for all nonempty disjoint sets A and B satisfying E = A \u222a B , there always exists a convergent sequence (x_n) \u2192 x with (x_n) contained in one of A or B , and x an element of the other. Then it means A \\cap \\overline{B} \\neq \\emptyset or B \\cap \\overline{A} \\neq \\emptyset . Theorem 3.4.7. A set E \u2286 R is connected if and only if whenever a < c < b with a, b \u2208 E , it follows that c \u2208 E as well. Proof: \\Rightarrow : Assume E \\subseteq R is connected. Given a < c < b with a, b \u2208 E , and assume c \\notin E . Consider A = \\{a \\in E | a < c\\} , B = \\{b \\in E | b > c\\} . For any (x_n) \\in A , since x_n < c , then (x_n) \\rightarrow x \\le c . So x \\notin B . Similarly, if (x_n) \\rightarrow x \\in B ,then x \\notin A . Then from Theorem 3.4.6, E is not connected. We have a contradiction. \\Leftarrow : Conversely assume a < c < b with a, b \u2208 E , it follows that c \u2208 E . Assume E = A \\cup B, a \\in A, b \\in B, a < b . Let A' = A \\cap (-\\infty, b), c = \\sup A' . So we have a \\le c \\le b, c \\in E . If c \\in B , then \\overline{A} \\cap B \\ne \\emptyset . If c \\in A , then c \\neq b , then (c, b] \\subseteq E . So c is a limit point of (c, b] , thus a limit point of B . So \\overline{B} \\cap A \\ne \\emptyset . Textbook method to prove \\Leftarrow (more elegant): assume a < c < b with a, b \u2208 E , it follows that c \u2208 E . Assume E = A \\cup B, a_0 \\in A, b_0 \\in B, a_0 < b_0, I_0 = [a_0, b_0] . Let c = (a_0 + b_0)/2 : if c \\in A , then a_1 = c, b_1 = b_0 . if c \\in B , then a_1 = a_0, b_1 = c, I_1 = [a_1, b_1] . Then we have I_0 \\supset I_1 \\supset \\cdots . From Nested Interval Property, we have \\lim a_n = \\lim b_n = x \\in \\cap I_n . 3.5 Baire\u2019s Theorem Definition 3.5.1. A set A \u2286 R is called an F_\u03c3 set if it can be written as the countable union of closed sets. A set B \u2286 R is called a G_\u03b4 set if it can be written as the countable intersection of open sets. Exercise 3.5.1. Argue that a set A is a G_\u03b4 set if and only if its complement is an F_\u03c3 set. Proof. Use De Morgan\u2019s Laws. Exercise 3.5.2. Replace each underscore with the word finite or countable, depending on which is more appropriate. (a) The finite/countable union of F_\u03c3 sets is an F_\u03c3 set. Both are correct. This is because countable union of countable sets is still countable union of sets. See also here . (b) The finite/countable intersection of F_\u03c3 sets is an F_\u03c3 set. Proof: First, countable intersection of F_\u03c3 sets might not be an F_\u03c3 set. Consider U_r = \\left\\{ x | x \\neq r \\right\\} where r is an rational number. Then U_r is F_\u03c3 set. But their intersection is I , which is all irrational numbers. As shown in Exercise 3.5.6, I cannot be F_\u03c3 set. Then finite intersection of F_\u03c3 sets might not be an F_\u03c3 set. Assume U = \\cup U_i and V = \\cup V_j . Then U \\cap V = \\cup U_i \\cap V_j . Since U_i \\cap V_j is closed. And there are countable of them, so U \\cap V is F_\u03c3 . (c) The finite/countable union of G_\u03b4 sets is a G_\u03b4 set. See (b) and De Morgan's law. (d) The finite/countable intersection of G_\u03b4 sets is a G_\u03b4 set. See (a) and De Morgan's law. Recall that a set G \u2286 \\mathbb{R} is dense in \\mathbb{R} if, given any two real numbers a<b , it is possible to find a point x \u2208 G with a<x<b . Theorem 3.5.2. If {G_1, G_2, G_3,...} is a countable collection of dense, open sets, then the intersection \\cap_{n=1}^\\infty G_n is not empty. Exercise 3.5.4. Prove Theorem 3.5.2. Proof: Since G_1 is open, we can find [a_1, b_1] \\subseteq G_1 . Since G_2 is dense, we can find [a_2, b_2] \\subseteq [a_1, b_1] and [a_2, b_2] \\subseteq G_2 . Then we construct a nested sequence of closed intervals I_1 \u2287 I_2 \u2287 I_3 \u2287\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 satisfying I_n \u2286 G_n . Exercise 3.5.5. Show that it is impossible to write R = \\cup_{n=1}^{\\infty} F_n where for each n \u2208 N , F_n is a closed set containing no nonempty open intervals. Proof: Consider G_n = (F_n)^c , so G_n is open, and it's also dense. Then from 3.5.4, the intersection of G_n is not empty. So the union of F_n cannot be the whole R . Exercise 3.5.6. Show how the previous exercise implies that the set I of irrationals cannot be an F_\u03c3 set, and Q cannot be a G_\u03b4 set. Proof: Assume I is an F_{\\sigma} set. I = \\cup_{n=1}^{\\infty} F_n F_n is a closed set containing no nonempty open intervals. And Q can be written as Q = \\cup_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\{q_n | q_n \\in Q\\} Q_n is a closed set containing no nonempty open intervals. And R = I \\cup Q . We have a contradiction. Exercise 3.5.7. Using Exercise 3.5.6 and versions of the statements in Exercise 3.5.2, construct a set that is neither in F_\u03c3 nor in G_\u03b4 . Solution: Let A = \\left\\{ x | x \\in [-1, 0] \\cap \\mathbf{I}\\right\\} and B = \\left\\{ x | x \\in [0, 1] \\cap \\mathbf{Q}\\right\\} . Let C = A \\cup B . Assume C is F_\u03c3 . We have C \\cap [-1, 0] = (A \\cup B) \\cap [-1, 0] = (A \\cap [-1, 0]) \\cup (B \\cap [-1, 0]) = A \\cup \\emptyset = A . So A is F_\u03c3 . But then \\mathbf{I} will be F_\u03c3 . We have a contradiction. Assume C is G_\u03b4 . C \\cap [0, 1] = (A \\cup B) \\cap [0, 1] = (A \\cap [0, 1]) \\cup (B \\cap [0, 1]) = \\emptyset \\cup B = B . We want to show B is not G_\u03b4 set. Assume otherwise. Consider B^c = (-\\infty, 0) \\cup ([0, 1] \\cap \\mathbf{I}) \\cup (1, \\infty) , which has to be F_\u03c3 .

Replace each underscore with the word finite or countable, depending on which is more appropriate. (a) The finite/countable union of F_\u03c3 sets is an F_\u03c3 set. Both are correct. This is because countable union of countable sets is still countable union of sets. See also here . (b) The finite/countable intersection of F_\u03c3 sets is an F_\u03c3 set. Proof: First, countable intersection of F_\u03c3 sets might not be an F_\u03c3 set. Consider U_r = \\left\\{ x | x \\neq r \\right\\} where r is an rational number. Then U_r is F_\u03c3 set.
